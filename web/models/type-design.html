For biological organisms, this is the genome. For a software application, it is the source code. For an airplane, this is a large collection of design documents, such as drawings and parts lists (or 3-D models). For a nation, it is a constitution. </p>

<p>Note that a type design must always be specified using a known type design language. </p>
