<p>And when we use the word &#8220;group,&#8221; I take this to mean a group of humans deriving perceived benefit from a shared set of resources, working towards a common goal, with some unifying identity, and with established means of interaction. </p>

<p>I originally encountered these principles in <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/profile/david-sloan-wilson/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Sloan Wilson</a>'s book, <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246844/this-view-of-life-by-david-sloan-wilson/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This View of Life</a>.</em> If you&#8217;d like another description of these principles that is freely available on the web, you can refer to this <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Generalizing-the-Core.pdf" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a> of an article originally published in the <em>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elinor Ostrom</a> won a Nobel Prize for her work in this area. These principles were based &#8211; not on abstract or aspirational ideas about how such groups <em>should</em> work, or reasons why they <em>could not possibly work</em> &#8211; but on actual observation of the attributes of groups that <em>actually did work</em>. </p>

<p>As soon as I read these, I recognized their significance, and the ways in which they supported and mirrored many of the principles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile software development</a> movement, with which I was already familiar.  </p>

<p>I believe these principles to be universal and scalable to groups of any size. </p>

<p>Here, then, are the eight core design principles for the efficacy of groups. </p>
