<p>Unlike each of the earlier levels that tend to experience the world only through their blinkered perspective, the integral level includes and transcends prior levels, and humans operating at this level tend to have flexible, dynamic, adaptive attitudes towards the social groups in which they participate. </p>

<p>Humans operating at this level tend to see existing social structures as systems that can be changed, rather than inflexible constructs, and may see themselves as change agents for systems, rather than players limited to operating within existing systems. </p>
