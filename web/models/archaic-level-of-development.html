					Model element: 
					Archaic Level of Development
				</h2>
				<p>This is really a pre-social level, prior to the introduction of any sort of society at all. </p>

<p>At this level, humans: </p>
<ul>
<li>are focused solely on immediate survival needs; </li>
<li>have a minimal sense of self; </li>
<li>exhibit behavior based on natural instincts and reflexes; </li>
<li>are concerned only for the physical self and physical environment; </li>
<li>possess nothing that we would recognize as society or culture. </li>
</ul>

<p>We may think of this first level as hopelessly primitive, but it&#8217;s important to include it, because all of us are still motivated by basic survival instincts: fight or flight, hunger, thirst, lust, avoidance of pain and physical danger, and so on. Some social structures can override these basic instincts &#8211; as when a soldier goes to war to protect his or her country &#8211; but these basic survival motivations are all still present, and so must be kept in mind and accounted for. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note, though, that a human being motivated only by these basic instincts is generally categorized as a sociopath, and for good reason. So while this level is a necessary starting point, nothing here offers table stakes to get you into the game called humanity. </p>
