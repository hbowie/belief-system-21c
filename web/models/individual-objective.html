<p>Unlike subjective perspectives, other objective observers should be able to put themselves in our shoes, and make the same observations that we have, from the same perspective. </p>

<p>One of the advantages of an objective perspective is that multiple independent observers should be able to agree on the characteristics or attributes of an object being observed, and can therefore reach agreement on what we generally describe as the facts of the matter. </p>

<p>The Individual Objective is depicted in the upper right quadrant of the diagram, and so is sometimes referred to simply as <em>UR</em>. </p>
