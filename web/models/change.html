<p>In other words, we must introduce some variation. </p>

<p>This will generally consist of some change to the <a href="type-design.html" class="wiki-link">type design</a> of the thing. </p>

<p>Note that a change can be accidental and made at random (as is the case with biological evolution), or it can be made based on some <a href="analysis.html" class="wiki-link">analysis</a>, with some forethought and anticipation of the consequences (as is generally the case with human design). </p>
