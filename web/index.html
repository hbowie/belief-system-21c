				<p>This site describes a belief system with about thirty basic components. </p>

<p>These are the things that I <em>believe to be true</em>, and also the things that I <em>believe in</em>: two different sorts of beliefs, in a way, but closely related. </p>

<p>These beliefs have some important characteristics. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>They are <em>foundational</em>. That is, they provide a solid foundation for other beliefs. </p></li>
<li><p>They are <em>coherent</em>. That is, they are consistent with one another, and in fact reinforce one another. </p></li>
<li><p>They are <em>complete</em>. That is, one can build other beliefs on top of these, but these form a complete starting platform for such efforts. </p></li>
<li><p>They are <em>effective</em>. That is, they offer a useful set of shared beliefs for a well-functioning human society. </p></li>
<li><p>They are <em>resonant</em>. That is, they reflect and amplify strands of belief found in many other models and notable quotations. </p></li>
<li><p>They are <em>modern</em>. That is, they take into account the knowledge and experience that we humans have so far accumulated as we make our way through the 21st century. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taken together, I believe these form a stable, useful and usable <em>Belief System for the 21st Century</em>. </p>
