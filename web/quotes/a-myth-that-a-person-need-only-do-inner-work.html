					<h3>&ldquo;A myth that a person need only do inner work&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need only do inner work, in order to be alive like this; that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself … The fact is, a person is so far formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings. </p>
