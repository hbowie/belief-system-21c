					<h3>&ldquo;We are idealists and we are realists&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>We are idealists and we are realists. We are dreamers and we are builders. We are experiencers and we are experimenters. We long for certainties, yet we ourselves are full of the ambiguities of the Mona Lisa and the I Ching. We ourselves are a part of the yin-yang of the world. </p>
