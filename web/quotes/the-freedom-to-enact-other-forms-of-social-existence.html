					<h3>&ldquo;The freedom to enact other forms of social existence&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>If something did go terribly wrong in human history &#8211; and given the current state of the world, it&#8217;s hard to deny something did &#8211; then perhaps it began to go wrong precisely when people started losing that freedom to imagine and enact other forms of social existence, to such a degree that some now feel this particular type of freedom hardly even existed, or was barely exercised, for the greater part of human history. </p>
