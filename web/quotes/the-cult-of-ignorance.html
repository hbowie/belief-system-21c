					<h3>&ldquo;The Cult of Ignorance&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>
