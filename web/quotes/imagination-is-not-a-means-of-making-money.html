					<h3>&ldquo;Imagination is not a means of making money&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>In America the imagination is generally looked on as something that might be useful when the TV is out of order. Poetry and plays have no relation to practical politics. Novels are for students, housewives, and other people who don&#8217;t work. Fantasy is for children and primitive peoples. Literacy is so you can read the operating instructions. I think the imagination is the single most useful tool mankind possesses. It beats the opposable thumb. I can imagine living without my thumbs, but not without my imagination. </p>

<p>I hear voices agreeing with me. &#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;The creative imagination is a tremendous plus in business! We value creativity, we reward it!&#8221; In the marketplace, the word creativity has come to mean the generation of ideas applicable to practical strategies to make larger profits. This reduction has gone on so long that the word creative can hardly be degraded further. I don&#8217;t use it any more, yielding it to capitalists and academics to abuse as they like. But they can&#8217;t have imagination. </p>

<p>Imagination is not a means of making money. It has no place in the vocabulary of profit-making. It is not a weapon, though all weapons originate from it, and their use, or non-use, depends on it, as with all tools and their uses. The imagination is an essential tool of the mind, a fundamental way of thinking, an indispensable means of becoming and remaining human. </p>
