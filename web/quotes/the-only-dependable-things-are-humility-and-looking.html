					<h3>&ldquo;The only dependable things are humility and looking&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Watching the man, hard-of-hearing, hard-of-speech Patty learns that real joy consists of knowing that human wisdom counts less than the shimmer of beeches in a breeze. As certain as weather is coming from the west, the things people know for sure will change. There is no knowing <em>for a fact</em>. The only dependable things are humility and looking. </p>
