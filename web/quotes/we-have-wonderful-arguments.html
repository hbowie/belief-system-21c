					<h3>&ldquo;We have wonderful arguments&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Jobs: What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And are people willing to tell you you&#8217;re wrong? </p>

<p>Jobs: (laughs) Yeah. </p>

<p>Mossberg: I mean, other than snarky journalists, I mean people that work forâ€¦ </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh, yeah, no we have wonderful arguments. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And do you win them all? </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can&#8217;t. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay. </p>

<p>Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. </p>

<p>Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn&#8217;t? </p>
