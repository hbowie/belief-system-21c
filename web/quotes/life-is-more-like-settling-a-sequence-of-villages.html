					<h3>&ldquo;Life is more like settling a sequence of villages&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Life is not really an individual journey. Life is more like settling a sequence of villages. You help build a community at home, at work, in your town and then you go off and settle more villages. </p>
