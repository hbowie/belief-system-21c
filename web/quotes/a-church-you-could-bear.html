					<h3>&ldquo;A church you could bear&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>We stayed with the blues and Francie sensing a vein of covenant sang in her scratchiest aching voice, the reason we cajoled her into the band to start with, and it began to resemble what I once imagined church might be like, a church you could bear, where people laughed and enjoyed each other and did not care if they were right all the time or if other people were wrong. </p>
