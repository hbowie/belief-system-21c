					<h3>&ldquo;A bicycle for our minds&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud of a showing for the Crown of Creation. That didn&#8217;t look so good, but then someone at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle and a human on a bicycle blew the condor away. That&#8217;s what a computer is to me: the computer is the most remarkable tool that we&#8217;ve ever come up with. It&#8217;s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. </p>
