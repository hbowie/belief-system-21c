					<h3>&ldquo;Defending the pursuit of learning&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>If the pursuit of learning is not defended by the educated citizen, it will not be defended at all. For there will always be those who scoff at intellectuals, who cry out against research, who seek to limit our educational system. Modern cynics and skeptics see no more reason for landing a man on the moon, which we shall do, than the cynics and skeptics of half a millennium ago saw for the discovery of this country. They see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing. </p>

<p>But the educated citizen knows how much more there is to know. He knows that &#8220;knowledge is power,&#8221; more so today than ever before. He knows that only an educated and informed people will be a free people, that the ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all, and that if we can, as Jefferson put it, &#8220;enlighten the people generally &#8230; tyranny and the oppressions of mind and body will vanish, like evil spirits at the dawn of day.&#8221; And, therefore, the educated citizen has a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning, to promote exploration of the unknown, to preserve the freedom of inquiry, to support the advancement of research, and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all Americans, from grade school to graduate school. </p>
