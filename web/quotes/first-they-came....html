					<blockquote>
						<p>First they came for the communists,  <br />
and I didn&#8217;t speak out because I wasn&#8217;t a communist. </p>

<p>Then they came for the trade unionists,  <br />
and I didn&#8217;t speak out because I wasn&#8217;t a trade unionist. </p>

<p>Then they came for the Jews,  <br />
and I didn&#8217;t speak out because I wasn&#8217;t a Jew. </p>

<p>Then they came for me  <br />
and there was no one left to speak out for me. </p>
