					<h3>&ldquo;Public Truth&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Reviving the common good also depends on each of us taking responsibility for finding, sharing, and insisting upon public truth. By public truth I mean facts about what is happening around us that could affect our well-being, as well as clear logic about the significance of those facts and reasoned analysis about their practical consequences. </p>
