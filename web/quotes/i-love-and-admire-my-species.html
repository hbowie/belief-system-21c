					<h3>&ldquo;I love and admire my species&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  </p>

<p>I do not make any of my own clothing.  </p>

<p>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  </p>

<p>I did not discover the mathematics I use.  </p>

<p>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  </p>

<p>I am moved by music I did not create myself.  </p>

<p>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  </p>

<p>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  </p>

<p>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. </p>
