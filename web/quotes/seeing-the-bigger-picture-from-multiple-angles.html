					<h3>&ldquo;Seeing the Bigger Picture from Multiple Angles&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>He [Jeff Bezos] said people who were right a lot of the time <em>were people who often changed their minds</em>. He doesn&#8217;t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It&#8217;s perfectly healthy &#8211; encouraged, even &#8211; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today. </p>

<p>He&#8217;s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they&#8217;d already solved. They&#8217;re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking. </p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary. </p>

<p>What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can&#8217;t climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they&#8217;re often wrong most of the time. </p>
