					<h3>&ldquo;Life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Human development research offers a different formula: All of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. If government can create a framework in which people grow up amid healthy families, nurturing schools, thick communities and a secure safety net, then they will have the resources and audacity to thrive in a free global economy and a diversifying skills economy. </p>
