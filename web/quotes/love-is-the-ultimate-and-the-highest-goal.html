					<h3>&ldquo;Love is the ultimate and the highest goal&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth &#8211; that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. </p>
