					<h3>&ldquo;Continually debating people and never winning&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You&#8217;ll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational. </p>
