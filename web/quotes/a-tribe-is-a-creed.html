					<h3>&ldquo;A tribe is a creed&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>A tribe is not a race, or even a population&#8230; a tribe is a creed; it is a team that has agreed upon a set of symbols &#8211; including sacred values &#8211; that identify membership. A creed is a mechanism that glues together disparate small camps and bands of cohabitating humans into a singular identity and shared purpose. Those who know the codes have in their possession a social passport. </p>
