					<h3>&ldquo;Making something with a great deal of care and love&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. </p>

<p>And you never meet the people. You never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us. </p>
