					<h3>&ldquo;Ism-mania&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Grandpa: Penny why don&#8217;t you write a play about ism-mania? </p>

<p>Penny: Ism-mania? </p>

<p>Grandpa: Yeah, sure, you know &#8211; communism, fascism, voodooism. Everybody&#8217;s got an ism these days. </p>

<p>Penny: I feel like I&#8217;ve got this itch or something. </p>

<p>Grandpa: It&#8217;s just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ism and you&#8217;re in business. </p>

<p>Penny: I&#8217;ve got it! It might help Cynthia to have an ism in the monastery! </p>

<p>Grandpa: It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans: John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison, Mark Twain. When things got tough for those boys, they didn&#8217;t run around looking for isms. Lincoln said, &#8220;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&#8221; Nowadays they say, &#8220;Think the way I do, or I&#8217;ll bomb the daylights out of you.&#8221; </p>
