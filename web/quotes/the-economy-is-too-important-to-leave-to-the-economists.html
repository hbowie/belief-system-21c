					<h3>&ldquo;The economy is too important to leave to the economists&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>This book grew out of my Greek publisher&#8217;s invitation, back in 2013, to talk directly to young people about the economy. My reason for writing it was the conviction that the economy is too important to leave to the economists. </p>
