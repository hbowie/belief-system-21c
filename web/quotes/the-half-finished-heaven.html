					<h3>&ldquo;The Half-Finished Heaven&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Despondency breaks off its course.  <br />
Anguish breaks off its course.  <br />
The vulture breaks off its flight. </p>

<p>The eager light streams out,  <br />
even the ghosts take a draught. </p>

<p>And our paintings see daylight,  <br />
our red beasts of the ice-age studios. </p>

<p>Everything begins to look around.  <br />
We walk in the sun in hundreds. </p>

<p>Each man is a half-open door  <br />
leading to a room for everyone. </p>

<p>The endless ground under us. </p>

<p>The water is shining among the trees. </p>

<p>The lake is a window into the earth. </p>
					</blockquote>
