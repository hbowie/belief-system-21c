					<h3>&ldquo;Each man is questioned by life&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. </p>
