					<h3>&ldquo;Never Knew Cocaine to Improve Anything&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>I listened in the studio control room as musicians&#8217; modes of consciousness-alteration proceeded from grass, hash and acid to heroin and cocaine by the 1970s. All but the latter could, on occasion, provide benefits, at least to the music. I never knew cocaine to improve anything&#8230;. I suspect that the surge in cocaine&#8217;s popularity explains &#8211; at least in part &#8211; why so many great sixties artists made such bad records in the following decade. </p>
