					<h3>&ldquo;When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State, the multi-racial, multi-religious communities that our Constitution seeks to weld together as one become separatist; antagonisms that relate to race or to religion, rather than to political issues, are generated; communities seek not the best representative, but the best racial or religious partisan. </p>
