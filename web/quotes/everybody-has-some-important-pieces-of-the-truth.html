					<h3>&ldquo;Everybody Has Some Important Pieces of the Truth&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>My work is an attempt to make room in the Kosmos for all of the dimensions, levels, domains, waves, memes, modes, individuals, cultures, and so on ad infinitum. I have one major rule: Everybody is right. More specifically, everybody &#8211; including me &#8211; has some important pieces of truth, and all of those pieces need to be honored, cherished, and included in a more gracious, spacious, and compassionate embrace. </p>
