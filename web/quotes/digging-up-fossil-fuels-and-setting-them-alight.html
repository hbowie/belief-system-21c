					<h3>&ldquo;Digging up fossil fuels and setting them alight&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>For two hundred years, human economic activity has largely consisted of digging up fossil fuels and setting them alight, and while two hundred years seems like a long time to us, in geological terms it’s like a bat out of… well, out of hell. We’re currently injecting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ten times faster than during the End-Permiasn, which was, just to repeat, the worst event in the earth’s history. </p>
