					<h3>&ldquo;Taking a Fence Down&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don&#8217;t see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don&#8217;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#8217;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>
