					<h3>&ldquo;Technological Unemployment&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come &#8211; namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour. </p>
