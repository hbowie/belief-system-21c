					<h3>&ldquo;Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship. If private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate, those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the Government for aid; and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response </p>
