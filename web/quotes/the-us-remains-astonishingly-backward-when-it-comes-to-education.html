					<h3>&ldquo;The US remains astonishingly backward when it comes to education&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate fact that the United States remains astonishingly backward compared to almost all other advanced Western countries when it comes to education, because in America, what predicts how well a child will do in school is not a child&#8217;s aptitude or hard work, but the status of the child&#8217;s parents &#8211; which is to say, their own levels of education and wealth. Other countries suffer from this condition too, but the United States is especially anachronistic. And it&#8217;s getting worse: The influence of this wealth predictor in the United States today has only been growing stronger in recent years. </p>
