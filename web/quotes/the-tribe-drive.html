					<h3>&ldquo;The Tribe Drive&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>The &#8220;Tribe Drive&#8221; is an ancient adaptation that has been a prerequisite for survival for 99.9 percent of our species&#8217; evolutionary history. It is a critical piece of cognitive machinery &#8211; honed by millions of years of evolution &#8211; that gave us the ability to navigate, both cooperatively and competitively, increasingly complex social landscapes. </p>
