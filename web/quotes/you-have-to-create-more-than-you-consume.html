					<h3>&ldquo;You have to create more than you consume&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out. </p>
