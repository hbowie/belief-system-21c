					<h3>&ldquo;Mass Movements and Boredom&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>There is perhaps no more reliable indicator of a societyâ€™s ripeness for a mass movement than the prevalence of unrelieved boredom. In almost all the descriptions of the periods preceding the rise of mass movements there is reference to vast ennui; and in their earliest stages mass movements are more likely to find sympathizers among the bored than among the exploited and suppressed. To a deliberate fomenter of mass upheavals, the report that people are bored stiff should be at least as encouraging as that they are suffering from intolerable economic or political abuses. </p>
