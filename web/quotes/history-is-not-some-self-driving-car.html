					<h3>&ldquo;History is not some self-driving car&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>But I have grave doubts about history&#8217;s long arc. History is not some self-driving car taking humanity to a pre-set destination. Whichever human is behind the wheel must ensure the others stay in the car. Telling some of the passengers they have no business in the driver&#8217;s seat because they are clueless about the destination will sooner or later result in a crash. &#8216;Take back control&#8217; was the chant of Brexiteers and Trump voters alike. It is the war cry of populist backlashes across the Western world. </p>
