					<h3>&ldquo;Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that!&#8221; said Alice. </p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you?&#8221; the Queen said in a pitying tone. &#8220;Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.&#8221; </p>

<p>Alice laughed. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use trying,&#8221; she said &#8220;one can&#8217;t believe impossible things.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you haven&#8217;t had much practice,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I&#8217;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&#8221; </p>
