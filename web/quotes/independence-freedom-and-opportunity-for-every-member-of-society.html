					<h3>&ldquo;Independence, freedom and opportunity for every member of society&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>At the same time, the Nordic theory of love has become an overarching philosophy about how to structure a society. As such, it has inspired the broad variety of policy choices in the Nordic nations that together ensure a single, predominant goal: independence, freedom and opportunity for every member of society. </p>
