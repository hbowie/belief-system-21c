					<h3>&ldquo;Great public space is a kind of magical good&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Most things that people buy in stores give them a lot of satisfaction the moment they buy them. But after a few days, that satisfaction decreases, and months later, it completely melts away. But great public space is a kind of magical good. It never ceases to yield happiness. It’s almost happiness itself. </p>
