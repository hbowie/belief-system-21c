					<h3>&ldquo;The Four-Fold Way&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>The following four principles, each based on an archetype, comprise what I call the Four-Fold Way: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Show up, or choose to be present.</em> Being present allows us to access the human resources of power, presence, and communication. This is the way of the Warrior. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Pay attention to what has heart and meaning.</em> Paying attention opens us to the human resources of love, gratitude, acknowledgment, and validation. This is the way of the Healer. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Tell the truth without blame or judgment.</em> Nonjudgmental truthfulness maintains our authenticity, and develops our inner vision and intuition. This is the way of the Visionary. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Be open to outcome, not attached to outcome.</em> Openness and nonattachment help us to recover the human resources of wisdom and objectivity. This is the way of the Teacher. </p></li>
</ol>
