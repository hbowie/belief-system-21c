					<h3>&ldquo;The only sensible procedure for a critic&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>The only sensible procedure for a critic is to keep silent about works which he believes to be bad, while at the same time vigorously campaigning for those which he believes to be good, especially if they are being neglected or underestimated by the public. </p>
