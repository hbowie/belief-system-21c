					<h3>&ldquo;Nature must govern technology&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>If we&#8217;re ever going to get the world back on a natural footing, back in tune with natural rhythyms, if we&#8217;re going to nurture the Earth and protect it and have fun with it and learn from it — which is what mothers do with their children — then we&#8217;ve got to put technology (an aggressive masculine system) in its proper place, which is that of a tool to be used sparingly, joyfully, gently and only in the fullest cooperation with nature. Nature must govern technology, not the other way around. </p>
