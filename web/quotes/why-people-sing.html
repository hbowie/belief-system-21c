					<h3>&ldquo;Why People Sing&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Someone once asked me why people sing. I answered they sing for many of the same reasons birds sing. They sing for a mate, to claim their territory, or simply to give voice to the delight of being alive in the midst of a beautiful day. Perhaps more than birds do, humans hold a grudge. They sing to complain of how grievously they have been wronged, and how to avoid it in the future. They sing to help themselves execute a job of work. They sing so the subsequent generations wonâ€™t forget what the current generation endured, or dreamed, or delighted in. </p>
