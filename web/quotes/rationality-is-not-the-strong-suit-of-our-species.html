					<h3>&ldquo;Rationality is not the strong suit of our species&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>My recommendations are not the typical tips from an academic about how to encourage more rational decisions. I think that rationality is not the strong suit of our species. We are <em>Homo tributus</em>, not <em>Homo economicus</em>. Certainly, tribal instincts are part of the problem in many pressing conflicts, but they also can be — and, I think, <em>have to be</em> — part of the solution. </p>
