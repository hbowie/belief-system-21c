					<h3>&ldquo;A world that is tolerable&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>We have to stop and pull back, look at ourselves and each other and wonder if there is a way that each and every one of us (or at least the vast majority of us) can agree on the elements that make a world that is tolerable: a world with enough food and warmth and pleasant distractions; a world where love and belief are okay, even primary. </p>
