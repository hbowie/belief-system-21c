					<h3>&ldquo;The encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>As we explore the natural history of tribalism, we will see that some three hundred thousand years ago humans chanced upon a revolutionary adaptation that led to the encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA. This was the evolution of nested groups, each with their own particular symbols &#8211; and enshrined shared myths and values &#8211; that bound participants together in trusting relationships. </p>
