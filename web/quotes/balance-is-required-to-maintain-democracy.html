					<h3>&ldquo;Balance is Required to Maintain Democracy&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Our current lack of respect for the swing can be likened to the current state of our democracy. Balance is required to maintain something as delicate as democracy, a subtle understanding of how your power can be magnified through joining with and sharing the power of another person. When that is no longer understood, it becomes a battle to see who is the strongest, who is the loudest, who can get the most attention. </p>
