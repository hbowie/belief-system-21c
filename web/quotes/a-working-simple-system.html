					<h3>&ldquo;A working simple system&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over beginning with a working simple system. </p>
