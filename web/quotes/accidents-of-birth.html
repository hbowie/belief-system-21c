					<h3>&ldquo;Accidents of birth&rdquo;</h3>
				
					<blockquote>
						<p>Today Americans still feel that by and large, every individual is responsible for constructing his or her own fate &#8211; the classic pursuit of happiness &#8211; and there is still much debate in the United States about the extent to which, if at all, an individual&#8217;s success or failure is also shaped by accidents of birth. Nordic people have long ago moved beyond this debate. To most Nordics it&#8217;s completely obvious that an accident of birth, like being born into poverty or a neighborhood without a good school, can severely disadvantage an individual and destroy any chances of success, no matter what he or she does. </p>
