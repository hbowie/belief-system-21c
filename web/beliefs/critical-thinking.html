		 <h4>&ldquo;Belief in Impossible Things&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is probably no job on earth for which an ability to believe six impossible things before breakfast is more of a requirement than software project management. We are routinely expected to work ourselves into a state of believing in a deadline, a budget, or a performance factor that time subsequently may prove to be impossible. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Belief is the end of Observation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>What you do is you have an idea, and you hold it in your mind as long as it’s useful. And then when it turns out not to be useful, discard it. But the idea of clinging to belief as a basis for your life &#8211; which is what most people do &#8211; is terrifying, because belief is the end of observation. You believe something, you stop seeing everything else. Clearly, that is not desirable. And yet it’s the way most people live. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Capitalism as a Market Society&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Readers may be surprised by the absence of any mention of &#8216;capital&#8217; or &#8216;capitalism&#8217; in the book. I chose to leave out such words not because there is anything wrong with them but because, loaded as they are with heavy baggage, they get in the way of illuminating the essence of things. So, instead of speaking about capitalism, I use the term &#8216;market society.&#8217; Instead of &#8216;capital,&#8217; you will find more normal words like &#8216;machinery&#8217; and &#8216;produced means of production.&#8217; Why use jargon if we can avoid it? </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Celestial Teapot&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Dr. Sally Ride, the first American woman in space and a member of the investigating board, believes that the Columbia tragedy and the 1986 Challenger Space Shuttle disaster resulted from the same mindset, saying: &#8216;(NASA) managers&#8230;did not grab onto this problem and insist on an answer. It was really quite the opposite. They assumed they knew the answer. They assumed the foam was not going to be a problem. And they were insisting that people disprove the preconception they had.&#8217; </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes, so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality. </p>

<p>For the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie &#8211; deliberate, contrived and dishonest &#8211; but the myth &#8211; persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Four-Fold Way&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The following four principles, each based on an archetype, comprise what I call the Four-Fold Way: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Show up, or choose to be present.</em> Being present allows us to access the human resources of power, presence, and communication. This is the way of the Warrior. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Pay attention to what has heart and meaning.</em> Paying attention opens us to the human resources of love, gratitude, acknowledgment, and validation. This is the way of the Healer. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Tell the truth without blame or judgment.</em> Nonjudgmental truthfulness maintains our authenticity, and develops our inner vision and intuition. This is the way of the Visionary. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Be open to outcome, not attached to outcome.</em> Openness and nonattachment help us to recover the human resources of wisdom and objectivity. This is the way of the Teacher. </p></li>
</ol>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Model II Decision-Making&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Model II encourages the individual to maximize his uniqueness. If, in doing so, he should arrive at goals that differ from those developed by others, he will have done so under conditions of openness, trust and risk-taking. The individual would therefore feel free to discuss his differences openly with the group. Moreover, if the individual is in a subordinate power position, and if he feels he had adequate opportunity to dissuade the group and that the group publicly confronted and tested all differences, then the individual will probably be motivated to work toward the group goal but still be motivated to generate new information that may change the group&#8217;s decision. This means that one can be externally committed to a decision and internally committed to the decision-making processes that produced the decision yet simultaneously monitor the consequences of the decision thoroughly to seek new, valid information to reconfront the decision without being considered disloyal. In the model-II world, conflicts do not disappear&#8211;indeed, the illusion of conflict disappearing is more typical of the model-I world, in which conflicts are settled by power plays based on sanctions, charisma or loyalty. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Most advertising an insane irrelevance&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It is often said that our society is too materialist, and that advertising reflects this&#8230;. But it seems to me that in this respect our society is quite evidently not materialist enough, and that this, paradoxically, is the result of a failure in social meaning, values and ideals&#8230;. If we were sensibly materialist, in that part of our living in which we use things, we should find most advertising to be of an insane irrelevance. Beer would be enough for us, without the additional promise that in drinking it we show ourselves to be manly, young in heart, or neighborly. A washing-machine would be a useful machine to wash clothes, rather than an indication that we are forward-looking or an object of envy to our neighbors. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Myth of Simple Truths&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It would be a wonderful world were the Simple Truth Thesis true. Our political task simply would be to empower those who know the simple truth, and rebuke the fools who do not. But the Simple Truth Thesis is not true. In fact, it&#8217;s a fairytale—soothing, but ultimately unfit for a serious mind. For any Big Question, there are several defensible positions; it is precisely this feature that makes them big. Of course, to say that a position is defensible is not to say that it&#8217;s true. To oppose the Simple Truth Thesis is not to embrace relativism (which is itself a version of the Simple Truth view), nor is it to give up on the idea that there is truth; it is rather to give up on the view that the truth is always simple. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Politics and the Debasement of Language&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you &#8211; even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent &#8211; and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Pursue not happiness, but discernment&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It finally came to me from Jimmy [Baldwin], who was so good at setting me straight. Happiness, he told me, is a very typical pursuit of the spoiled, who have, for the most part, had things brought to their tables, their attention, their inspection. I needed to pursue not happiness, he told me, but discernment. </p>

<p>“You understand,&#8220; he said to me, &#8221;the ability and the art of editing a film. You can transform a performance by what you clip or elide or move. A stunningly bad actor or performance can be transformed by how and where you place it. It has been edited, and so it is not an honest—or realistic—presentation of what took place. </p>

<p>“Well, we don’t understand reality too well. We think that what is placed before us is real, because we are either lazy or stupid — we don’t look around for what else is out there or within us or within each other, so we say, This is real. But if we remove the negative friend, the toxic thought, the temptations that topple us, then a new ‘reality’ appears. We get the reality we build, edit, post, print, distribute. </p>

<p>“Don’t accept the evil thought, the prejudiced view, the pessimistic view of the world. Accept a role in making the world better, and go out and edit it." That is what Jimmy always sought to do: Edit the world; edit his friends; edit himself. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Rationality is not the strong suit of our species&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>My recommendations are not the typical tips from an academic about how to encourage more rational decisions. I think that rationality is not the strong suit of our species. We are <em>Homo tributus</em>, not <em>Homo economicus</em>. Certainly, tribal instincts are part of the problem in many pressing conflicts, but they also can be — and, I think, <em>have to be</em> — part of the solution. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. </p>

<p>As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Seeing the Bigger Picture from Multiple Angles&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>He [Jeff Bezos] said people who were right a lot of the time <em>were people who often changed their minds</em>. He doesn&#8217;t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It&#8217;s perfectly healthy &#8211; encouraged, even &#8211; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today. </p>

<p>He&#8217;s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they&#8217;d already solved. They&#8217;re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking. </p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary. </p>

<p>What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can&#8217;t climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they&#8217;re often wrong most of the time. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Skepticism and Openness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. Obviously those two modes of thought are in some tension. But if you are able to exercise only one of these modes, whichever one it is, you’re in deep trouble. </p>

<p>Some ideas are better than others. The machinery for distinguishing them is an essential tool in dealing with the world and especially in dealing with the future. And it is precisely the mix of these two modes of thought that is central to the success of science. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Symbolic Language&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>At the moment, the most powerful marker, the feature that distinguishes our species most decisively from closely related species, appears to be symbolic language. Many animals can communicate with each other and share information in rudimentary ways. But humans are the only creatures who can communicate using symbolic language: a system of arbitrary symbols that can be linked by formal grammars to create a nearly limitless variety of precise utterances. Symbolic language greatly enhanced the precision of human communication and the range of ideas that humans can exchange. Symbolic language allowed people for the first time to talk about entities that were not immediately present (including experiences and events in the past and future) as well as entities whose existence was not certain (such as souls, demons, and dreams). </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Taking a Fence Down&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don&#8217;t see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don&#8217;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#8217;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>

<li><p>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. </p></li>
<li><p>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p></li>
<li><p>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p></li>
<li><p>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p></li>
<li><p>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool&#8217;s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness. </p></li>

		 <h4>&ldquo;This faith in consciousness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are ambivalent, combative, stubborn, wildly changeable beings that have the natural schizophrenic facility to love and hate at the same time. We respond, with Pavlovian predictability, to invisible forces such as the economic infrastructure, ever-changing technology, and unconscious instincts, all the while believing that we are fully conscious beings making decisions based on logic arisen from observations informed by eternal truths. This faith in consciousness is, in the mildest language possible, misplaced. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Those Sharp, Scratchy, Harsh, Almost Unpleasant Guys&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I never hesitated to promote someone I didn&#8217;t like. The comfortable assistant, the nice guy you like to go on fishing trips with, is a great pitfall. Instead I looked for those sharp, scratchy, harsh, almost unpleasant guys who see and tell you about things as they really are. If you can get enough of them around you and have patience enough to hear them out, there is no limit to where you can go. </p>

			 <p>It is the civic responsibility of all of us to check the facts we read or hear, to find and depend upon reliable sources, to share the truth with others, and hold accountable those who lie to us or suppress the truth. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;To prolong our presence on the face of the Earth&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>What we&#8217;re doing now is trying to think like nature, in the sense that we are aware that species that have gone before us have disappeared from the face of the Earth. We&#8217;d like to use our intelligence and our creative capacity to prolong our presence on the face of the Earth as long as possible. It requires, therefore, that we develop the kinds of tactics and strategies amongst ourselves so as to assure that this can occur, to assure that we will not destroy ourselves or the planet, to make it uninhabitable and to allow the fullness of the potential of the individual to be expressed, to flower. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Underlying Principle of the Problem&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don&#8217;t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it&#8217;s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That&#8217;s sort of the middle, and that&#8217;s where most people stop&#8230;. But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &#8211; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That&#8217;s what we wanted to do with Mac. </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can&#8217;t. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay. </p>
