				<h2>A Systemic Approach</h2>
				<p>In order to achieve positive outcomes from the complex social, economic and ecological systems in which we live, we must think systemically &#8211; rather than simply focusing on the individual actors within these systems &#8211; and we must identify root causes for our problems and take action as close to those roots as is practical. </p>
