		 <h4>&ldquo;Capitalists who worship only at the feet of capitalism&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Democratic capitalism is a wonderful device precisely because it maximizes the ability of individuals within society to singly and collectively pursue the ends that <em>they</em> find to be important and meaningful; the accomplishments of a capitalistic society are noble and grand to the extent that the ends pursued by its individuals aspire to these lofty goals, and bereft to the extent that the intentions of its citizens are mean and unworthy; nothing makes capitalism appear more hollow than capitalists who worship only at the feet of capitalism: they are like workmen who have fallen in love with their tools, while blind to the glories of the cathedrals these tools have built and can yet build. </p>

			 <p>The increase of wealth is not boundless. A stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the art of living, and much more likelihood of it being improved, when minds ceased to be engrossed by the art of getting on. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Invest in your employees&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I give them [other business owners] the same advice my grandfather had when he was starting the business [Dick&#8217;s Drive-Ins]. A business, first step, is it has to make a profit. The next step is to invest in your employees. They&#8217;ll take better care of your customers, which will help you earn more profit. When they move on from your business and do other things, they&#8217;re evangelists for your company and that helps you make more profit. Once that virtuous cycle is going, you can also invest in your community because if your community is thriving, your business will thrive. And so for these businesses that come to us asking what they should do first, the biggest thing I tell them is to talk to your employees. Ask them what it is that your employee population would want. Talk to them! Start with that. And if you can&#8217;t do it for everybody or everything that they would want, just do some part of it, then work your way up from there. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Liberalism is not Socialism, and never will be. There is a great gulf fixed. It is not a gulf of method, it is a gulf of principle. … Socialism seeks to pull down wealth. Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private interests; Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely by reconciling them with public right. Socialism would kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference … Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism exalts the man. Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The word &#8216;economics&#8217; was coined by the philosopher Xenophon in Ancient Greece. Combining <em>oikos</em> meaning household with <em>nomos</em> meaning rules or norms, he invented the art of household management, and it could not be more relevant today. This century we need some pretty insightful managers to guide our planetary household, and ones who are ready to pay attention to the needs of all of its inhabitants. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A Progressive Annual Tax on Capital&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital. This will make it possible to avoid an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation&#8230;. This would contain the unlimited growth of global inequality of wealth, which is currently increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained in the long run and that ought to worry even the most fervent champions of the self-regulated market. Historical experience shows, moreover, that such immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial spirit and are of no use in promoting growth. Nor are they of any &#8216;common utility,&#8217; to borrow the nice expression from the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen with which I began this book. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A Work Ethic Gone Mad&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Writing in the 1950s, Daniel Bell, the great American sociologist, said &#8216;economic growth has become the secular religion of advancing industrial societies&#8217;. He was right. It follows that in its absence, many people lapse into the equivalent of atheism. That sense of listlessness shows up in many ways. In the labour market, it means falling rates of workforce participation. Much as the desire to worship falls in agnostic societies, the yen to work drops in flat economies. In the last decade, America&#8217;s share of people in full-time jobs has dropped to European levels, which used to be written off as a sclerotic consequence of the continent&#8217;s over-regulated labour markets. Now the US rate is bang on the European average. In some respects it is worse. There is now a higher share of French males in full-time jobs than Americans &#8211; a statistic that reflects poorly on America, rather than well on France. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;You have to create more than you consume&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out. </p>
