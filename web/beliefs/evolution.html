		 <h4>&ldquo;Apes and Humans&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Philosophers and scientists confidently offer up traits said to be uniquely human, and the apes casually knock them down &#8211; toppling the pretension that humans constitute some sort of biological aristocracy among the beings of Earth. Instead, we are more like the nouveau riche, incompletely accommodated to our recent exalted state, insecure about who we are, and trying to put as much distance as possible between us and our humble origins. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The chicken experiment&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>But the chicken experiments suggest that this logic is flawed &#8211; even for farm animals where eugenics is a common practice. It seems Francis Galton was deeply mistaken about the relationship between individual abilities and societal welfare. The number of eggs laid by an individual hen is not an individual trait so much as it is a social trait, because it depends upon how members of the group behave towards each other. If the individuals who profit most from a social group do not contribute to the group&#8217;s welfare, and if their traits are heritable, then selecting for them results in the collapse of the society. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Competition is not separable from endless flavors of cooperation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Her trees are far more social than even Patricia suspected. There are no individuals. There aren&#8217;t even separate species. Everything in the forest is the forest. Competition is not separable from endless flavors of cooperation. Trees fight no more than do the leaves on a single tree. It seems most of nature <em>isn&#8217;t</em> red in tooth and claw, after all. For one, those species at the base of the living pyramid have neither teeth nor talons. But if trees share their storehouses, then every drop of red must float on a sea of green. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Evolutionary Drive Towards Complexity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The evolutionary drive towards complexity comes, in those lineages where it comes at all, not from any inherent propensity for increased complexity, and not from biased mutation. It comes from natural selection: the process which, as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The malleability of life&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It is sobering to contemplate the malleability of life. It only takes five generations to turn a population of mild-mannered chickens into a population of psychopaths. If we don&#8217;t manage evolutionary processes, they will very likely take us where we don&#8217;t want to go. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Small groups are a fundamental unit of human social organization&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Multilevel selection theory tells us that something similar to team-level selection took place in our species for thousands of generations, resulting in adaptations for teamwork that are baked into the genetic architecture of our minds. Absorbing this fact leads to the conclusion that <em>small groups are a fundamental unit of human social organization</em>. Individuals cannot be understood except in the context of small groups, and large-scale societies need to be seen as a kind of multicellular organism comprising small groups. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Which side will lose by winning&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Aspens are withering. Grazed on by everything with hooves, cut off from rejuvenating fire, whole groves are vanishing. Now she sees a forest, spreading across these mountains since before humans left Africa, giving way to second homes. She sees it in one great glimpse of flashing gold: trees and humans, at war over the land and water and atmosphere. And she can hear, louder than the quaking leaves, which side will lose by winning. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A working simple system&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over beginning with a working simple system. </p>
