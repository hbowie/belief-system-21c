				<h2>Humanism</h2>
				<p>Humanism emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, without reference to any non-human authorities. </p>

<p>This does not negate the value of various religious works: books, stories, songs and other works of <a href="art.html" class="wiki-link">Art</a>. But it does suggest that no particular religion, and no particular religious authority, and no particular religious text, should be viewed as a singular source of absolute truth. </p>

<p>This belief is also not meant to discount the value of other non-human life forms; rather it should be viewed as an acknowledgment that we humans are, if nothing else, irredeemably human, and so we inevitably look at the world through a human lens. </p>

<p>Humanism is often viewed as simply a matter of banging the drum for <a href="science.html" class="wiki-link">science</a>, and against religion, and is sometimes treated as if it were synonymous with atheism. </p>

<p>What I am talking about here is more expansive than this narrow definition. </p>
