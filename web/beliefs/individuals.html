		 <h4>&ldquo;The Undisputed Sovereignty of the Human Being&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Jazz insists on the undisputed sovereignty of the human being. In this technological era we can easily be fooled into believing that sophisticated machines are more important than progressive humanity. That&#8217;s why art is an important barometer of identity. The arts let us know who we are in all of our glory, reveal the best of who we are. All the political and financial might in the world is diminished when put to the service of an impoverished cultural agenda. We see it in our schools, in our homes, and in our world profile: rich and fat, lazy and morally corrupt, with wild, out-of-control young people. </p>

<p>We all know that civilization requires a supreme effort. Our technology will become outmoded, but the technology of the human soul does not change. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;All must be held valuable, or none&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>&#8220;But none of us has the right to assess the value of a human existence. All must be held valuable, or none. The death of Christ and the death of Socrates,&#8221; Fen added dryly, &#8220;suggest that our judgments are scarcely infallible&#8230; And the evil of Nazism lay precisely in this, that a group of men began to differentiate between the value of their fellow-beings, and to act on their conclusions. It isn&#8217;t a habit which I, for one, would like to encourage.&#8221; </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;All of us are trim tabs&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>One guy, he had nothing to do with the movies, but I&#8217;ve taken a lot of direction from him. That&#8217;s Bucky Fuller. Bucky, he&#8217;s most famous for the geodesic dome, but he made a great observation about these oceangoing tankers. And he noticed that the engineers were particularly challenged by how to turn this thing, you know? They got this big rudder, it took too much energy to turn the rudder to turn the ship. So they came up with a brilliant idea. Let&#8217;s put a little rudder on the big rudder. The little rudder will turn the big rudder, the big rudder will turn the ship. The little rudder is called a trim tab. </p>

<p>Bucky made the analogy that a trim tab is an example of how the individual is connected to society and how we affect society. And I like to think of myself as a trim tab. All of us are trim tabs. We might seem like we&#8217;re not up to the task, but we are, man. We&#8217;re alive! We can make a difference! We can turn this ship in the way we wanna go, man! Towards love, creating a healthy planet for all of us. </p>

			 <p>But I have grave doubts about history&#8217;s long arc. History is not some self-driving car taking humanity to a pre-set destination. Whichever human is behind the wheel must ensure the others stay in the car. Telling some of the passengers they have no business in the driver&#8217;s seat because they are clueless about the destination will sooner or later result in a crash. &#8216;Take back control&#8217; was the chant of Brexiteers and Trump voters alike. It is the war cry of populist backlashes across the Western world. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>But this Nation was not founded solely on the principle of citizens&#8217; rights. Equally important, though too often not discussed, is the citizen&#8217;s responsibility. For our privileges can be no greater than our obligations. The protection of our rights can endure no longer than the performance of our responsibilities. Each can be neglected only at the peril of the other. I speak to you today, therefore, not of your rights as Americans, but of your responsibilities. They are many in number and different in nature. They do not rest with equal weight upon the shoulders of all. Equality of opportunity does not mean equality of responsibility. All Americans must be responsible citizens, but some must be more responsible than others, by virtue of their public or their private position, their role in the family or community, their prospects for the future, or their legacy from the past. </p>

<p>Increased responsibility goes with increased ability, for &#8220;of those to whom much is given, much is required.&#8221; </p>

			 <p>Jazz is the most flexible art form ever because it believes in the good taste of individuals. It believes in our ability to make reasonable choices. It takes a chance on our decision-making skills instead of legislating our freedom away with written restrictions and restrictive hierarchies. In jazz, the size of your heart and your ability to play determine your position in the band. The philosophy of jazz is rooted in the elevation and enrichment of people, plain ol&#8217; folks. </p>

			 <p>True character arises from a deeper well than religion. It is the internalization of moral principles of a society, augmented by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure through trials of solitude and adversity. The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity, literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions feel good and true. Character is in turn the enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others. It is not obedience to authority, and while it is often consistent with and reinforced by religious belief, it is not piety. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Vital and Significant Forms of Art&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Nor is it any part of my thesis to maintain that it [the detective story] is a vital and significant form of art. There are no vital and significant forms of art; there is only art, and precious little of that. The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount; it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;We All Derive From the Same Source&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read those lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe in our own powers, our own criterion of truth and beauty. Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. We all derive from the same source. there is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part of creation, all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up, only to discover what is already there. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Wriggling&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars. But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle. </p>
