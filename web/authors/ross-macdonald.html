		 <h4>&ldquo;The more they yearned for omnipotence&rdquo;</h4>

			 <p>Blackwell was a sad and troubled man, hardly competent to play God with anybodyâ€™s life. But the sadder and more troubled they were, the more they yearned for omnipotence. The really troubled ones believed they had it. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Moving across the city's great broken body&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I had to admit to myself that I lived for nights like these, moving across the city&#8217;s great broken body, making connections among its millions of cells. I had a crazy wish or fantasy that some day before I died, if I made all the right neural connections, the city would come all the way alive. Like the Bride of Frankenstein. </p>
