		 <h4>&ldquo;Technological Unemployment&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come &#8211; namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;To live wisely and agreeably and well&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Thus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem &#8211; how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved. </p>
