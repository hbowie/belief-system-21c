		 <h4>&ldquo;Bathing in mystery and confusion&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I don’t mean to suggest that we have the final answers; we are bathing in mystery and confusion on many subjects, and I think that will always be our destiny. The universe will always be much richer than our ability to understand it. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Skepticism and Openness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. Obviously those two modes of thought are in some tension. But if you are able to exercise only one of these modes, whichever one it is, you’re in deep trouble. </p>

<p>Some ideas are better than others. The machinery for distinguishing them is an essential tool in dealing with the world and especially in dealing with the future. And it is precisely the mix of these two modes of thought that is central to the success of science. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Books are key to understanding the world&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>For 99 percent of the tenure of humans on earth, nobody could read or write. The great invention had not yet been made. Except for firsthand experience, almost everything we knew was passed on by word of mouth. As in the children&#8217;s game &#8220;Telephone,&#8221; over tens and hundreds of generations, information would slowly be distorted and lost. </p>

<p>Books changed all that. Books, purchasable at low cost, permit us to interrogate the past with high accuracy; to tap the wisdom of our species; to understand the point of view of others, and not just those in power; to contemplate &#8211; with the best teachers &#8211; the insights, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history. They allow people long dead to talk inside our heads. Books can accompany us everywhere. Books are patient where we are slow to understand, allow us to go over the hard parts as many times as we wish, and are never critical of our lapses. </p>

<p>Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society. </p>
