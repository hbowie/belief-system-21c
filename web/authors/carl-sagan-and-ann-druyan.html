		 <h4>&ldquo;Apes and Humans&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Philosophers and scientists confidently offer up traits said to be uniquely human, and the apes casually knock them down &#8211; toppling the pretension that humans constitute some sort of biological aristocracy among the beings of Earth. Instead, we are more like the nouveau riche, incompletely accommodated to our recent exalted state, insecure about who we are, and trying to put as much distance as possible between us and our humble origins. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Chimps and Humans&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>On the basis of all the evidence, the closest relative of the human proves to be the chimp. The closest relative of the chimp is the human. Not orangs, but people. Us. Chimps and humans are nearer kin than are chimps and gorillas or any other kinds of ape not of the same species. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A raving demagogue counseling hatred&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>So next time you hear a raving demagogue counseling hatred for other, slightly different groups of humans, for a moment at least see if you can understand his problem: He is heeding an ancient call that &#8211; however dangerous, obsolete, and maladaptive it may be today &#8211; once benefitted our species. </p>
