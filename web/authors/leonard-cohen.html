		 <h4>&ldquo;Deeper convictions of the heart&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Does he learn anything from writing them [his songs]? Does he work out ideas that way? </p>

<p>&#8220;I think you work out something. I wouldn&#8217;t call them ideas. I think ideas are what you want to get rid of. I don&#8217;t really like songs with ideas. They tend to become slogans. They tend to be on the right side of things: ecology or vegetarianism or antiwar. All these are wonderful ideas but I like to work on a song until those slogans, as wonderful as they are and as wholesome as the ideas they promote are, dissolve into deeper convictions of the heart. I never set out to write a didactic song. It&#8217;s just my experience. All I&#8217;ve got to put in a song is my own experience.&#8221; </p>
