			 <p>The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship. If private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate, those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the Government for aid; and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response </p>
