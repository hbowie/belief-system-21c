		 <h4>&ldquo;Down These Mean Streets&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. If there were enough like him, I think the world would be a very safe place to live in, and yet not too dull to be worth living in. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Vital and Significant Forms of Art&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Nor is it any part of my thesis to maintain that it [the detective story] is a vital and significant form of art. There are no vital and significant forms of art; there is only art, and precious little of that. The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount; it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;I'll take the big sordid dirty crooked city&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The other part of me wanted to get out and stay out. But this was the part I never listened to. Because if I ever had I would have stayed in the town where I was born and worked in the hardware store and married the boss&#8217;s daughter and had five kids and read them the funny paper on Sunday morning and smacked their heads when they got out of line and squabbled with the wife about how much spending money they were to get and what programs they could have on the radio or TV set. I might even have got rich &#8211; small-town rich, an eight-room house, two cars in the garage, chicken every Sunday and the <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> on the living room table, the wife with a cast iron permanent and me with a brain like a sack of Portland cement. You take it, friend. I&#8217;ll take the big sordid dirty crooked city. </p>
