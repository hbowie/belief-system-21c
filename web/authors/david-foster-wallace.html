		 <h4>&ldquo;Learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>As I&#8217;m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts clich√© about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Most Precious Kind of Freedom&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>But there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of winning and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the &#8220;rat race&#8221; &#8211; the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing. </p>
