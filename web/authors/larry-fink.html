		 <h4>&ldquo;The Power of Stakeholder Capitalism&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not “woke.” It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;We need governments to provide clear pathways&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change. But businesses can’t do this alone, and they cannot be the climate police. That will not be a good outcome for society. We need governments to provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy, regulation, and disclosure across markets. When we harness the power of both the public and private sectors, we can achieve truly incredible things. This is what we must do to get to net zero. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Workers demanding more from their employers&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Workers demanding more from their employers is an essential feature of effective capitalism. It drives prosperity and creates a more competitive landscape for talent, pushing companies to create better, more innovative environments for their employees – actions that will help them achieve greater profits for their shareholders. Companies that deliver are reaping the rewards. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Your company’s purpose is its north star&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It’s never been more essential for CEOs to have a consistent voice, a clear purpose, a coherent strategy, and a long-term view. Your company’s purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment. Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success. </p>
