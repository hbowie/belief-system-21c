		 <h4>&ldquo;This faith in consciousness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are ambivalent, combative, stubborn, wildly changeable beings that have the natural schizophrenic facility to love and hate at the same time. We respond, with Pavlovian predictability, to invisible forces such as the economic infrastructure, ever-changing technology, and unconscious instincts, all the while believing that we are fully conscious beings making decisions based on logic arisen from observations informed by eternal truths. This faith in consciousness is, in the mildest language possible, misplaced. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Thralls to group instincts&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Maybe bees and ants don&#8217;t mind being thralls to group instincts but people, I feel, do. And so the question that human beings must ask is, &#8220;How do I live my own life and survive, even prosper, while sharing the load of the greater culture?&#8221; </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A world that is tolerable&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We have to stop and pull back, look at ourselves and each other and wonder if there is a way that each and every one of us (or at least the vast majority of us) can agree on the elements that make a world that is tolerable: a world with enough food and warmth and pleasant distractions; a world where love and belief are okay, even primary. </p>
