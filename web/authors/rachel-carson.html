		 <h4>&ldquo;The conquest of nature&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Man has long talked somewhat arrogantly about the conquest of nature; now he has the power to achieve his boast. It is our misfortune &#8211; it may well be our final tragedy &#8211; that this power has not been tempered with wisdom, but has been marked by irresponsibility; that there is all too little awareness that man is part of nature, and that the price of conquest may well be the destruction of man himself. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Your generation must come to terms with the environment&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The stream of time moves forward and mankind moves with it. Your generation must come to terms with the environment. You must face realities instead of taking refuge in ignorance and evasion of truth. Yours is a grave and sobering responsibility, but it is also a shining opportunity. You go out into a world where mankind is challenged, as it has never been challenged before, to prove its maturity and its mastery â€” not of nature, but of itself. </p>

<p>Therein lies our hope and our destiny. </p>
