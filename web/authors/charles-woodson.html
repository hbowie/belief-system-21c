		 <h4>&ldquo;To simply see human beings&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>If I ask you all today to look around and tell me who you see&#8230;. When you look around, I don&#8217;t want you to see black, white, Asian, I don&#8217;t want you to wonder if a person is Democrat or Republican, gay or straight. When you look around, I just want you to simply see human beings &#8211; nothing more, nothing less. And I guarantee you, if you can begin to see people that way, just as human beings, you&#8217;ll begin to treat them a little differently, you&#8217;ll begin to understand their points of view. </p>
