		 <h4>&ldquo;Only Connect&rdquo;</h4>

			 <p>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Rainbow Bridge&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Mature as he was, she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion. Without it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts, unconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the gray, sober against the fire. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Wriggling&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars. But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle. </p>
