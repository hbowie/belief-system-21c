		 <h4>&ldquo;The Golden Eternity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I have lots of things to teach you now, in case we ever meet, concerning the message that was transmitted to me under a pine tree in North Carolina on a cold winter moonlit night. It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don&#8217;t know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Practice kindness all day to everybody&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The world you see is just a movie in your mind.  <br />
Rocks don&#8217;t see it.  <br />
Bless and sit down.  <br />
Forgive and forget.  <br />
Practice kindness all day to everybody  <br />
and you will realize you’re already  <br />
in heaven now.  <br />
That’s the story.  <br />
That’s the message.  <br />
Nobody understands it,  <br />
nobody listens, they’re  <br />
all running around like chickens with heads cut   <br />
off. I will try to teach it but it will   <br />
be in vain, s’why I’ll   <br />
end up in a shack   <br />
praying and being  <br />
cool and singing   <br />
by my woodstove   <br />
making pancakes. </p>
