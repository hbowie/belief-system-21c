		 <h4>&ldquo;The Only Sign of Mental Activity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The other pictures varied between the sentimentally lewd and the illustrated Scotch joke variety wherein Glengarried dogs take the place of figures. There were no books and a small writing table with drawers was the only sign of mental activity. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Merely Thoroughly Outrageous&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>He made the discovery with a certain amount of relief, since it took him at least out of the region of pure fantasy and into the merely thoroughly outrageous, with which as a modern he was by now more or less familiar. </p>
