		 <h4>&ldquo;Men Fear Thought&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth &#8211; more than ruin &#8211; more even than death&#8230;. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Ten Commandments for Teachers&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <ol>
<li><p>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light. </p></li>
<li><p>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. </p></li>
<li><p>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p></li>
<li><p>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p></li>
<li><p>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p></li>
<li><p>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool&#8217;s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness. </p></li>
</ol>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Celestial Teapot&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;How to Grow Old&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river â€” small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. </p>
