		 <h4>&ldquo;Capitalism as a Market Society&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Readers may be surprised by the absence of any mention of &#8216;capital&#8217; or &#8216;capitalism&#8217; in the book. I chose to leave out such words not because there is anything wrong with them but because, loaded as they are with heavy baggage, they get in the way of illuminating the essence of things. So, instead of speaking about capitalism, I use the term &#8216;market society.&#8217; Instead of &#8216;capital,&#8217; you will find more normal words like &#8216;machinery&#8217; and &#8216;produced means of production.&#8217; Why use jargon if we can avoid it? </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The economy is too important to leave to the economists&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>This book grew out of my Greek publisher&#8217;s invitation, back in 2013, to talk directly to young people about the economy. My reason for writing it was the conviction that the economy is too important to leave to the economists. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Opposite of Popularizing Economics&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>This is why this book is my attempt to do the opposite of popularizing economics: if it succeeds, it should incite its readers to take the economy into their own hands and make them realize that to understand the economy they also have to understand why the self-appointed experts on the economy, the economists, are almost always wrong. Ensuring that everyone is allowed to talk authoritatively about the economy is a prerequisite for a good society and a precondition for an authentic democracy. The economy&#8217;s ups and downs determine our lives; its forces make a mockery of our democracies; its tentacles reach deep into our souls, where they shape our hopes and aspirations. If we defer to the experts on the economy, we effectively hand them <em>all</em> decisions that matter. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Seeking ways to disagree with myself&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It has allowed me to return to a long-lost self who once wrote in peace and quiet &#8230; doing what I have always loved: finding ways to disagree with myself in order to discover what my true thoughts are. </p>
