		 <h4>&ldquo;A mind is blown&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A mind is blown when something you always feared but knew to be impossible turns out to be true; when the world turns out far vaster, far more marvelous or malevolent than you ever dreamed; when you get proof that everything is connected to everything else, that everything you know is wrong, that you are both the center of the universe and a tiny speck sailing off its nethermost edge. </p>
