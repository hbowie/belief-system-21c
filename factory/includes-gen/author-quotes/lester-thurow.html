		 <h4>&ldquo;Societies are not merely statistical aggregations&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Societies are not merely statistical aggregations of individuals engaged in voluntary exchange but something much more subtle and complicated. A group or community cannot be understood if the unit of analysis is the individual taken by himself. A society is clearly something greater than the sum of its parts. </p>
