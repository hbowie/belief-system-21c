		 <h4>&ldquo;The Extent of Freedom in All of its Dimensions&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. </p>
