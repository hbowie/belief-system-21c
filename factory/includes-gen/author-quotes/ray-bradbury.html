		 <h4>&ldquo;Start with romance and build to a reality&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I think it’s part of the nature of man to start with romance and build to a reality. There’s hardly a scientist or an astronaut I’ve met who wasn’t beholden to some romantic before him who led him to doing something in life. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;People ask me to predict the future&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>People ask me to predict the future, when all I want to do is prevent it. Better yet, build it. Predicting the future is much too easy, anyway. You look at the people around you, the street you stand on, the visible air you breathe, and predict more of the same. To hell with more. I want better. </p>
