		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Perhaps the greatest cognitive barrier we face in making sense of the world is that we have come to view certain realities as part of a &#8220;natural order&#8221; that will remain unchallenged. In fact, many &#8220;fundamental truths&#8221; that we take for granted are simply the fragile constructs of history and could shift radically in the decade ahead. </p>
