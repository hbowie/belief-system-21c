		 <h4>&ldquo;A strange magic in human-made things&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There can be a strange magic in human-made things. Not in all of them: not in plastic bottles or Q-Tips or batteries; but in those that are interwoven with our pasts, with our homes, with our great loves. These are things that have been mysteriously imbued with humanity — our own or other people’s. </p>
