		 <h4>&ldquo;What we need for happiness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>And what are our needs for happiness? We need to walk, just as birds need to fly. We need to be around other people. We need beauty. We need contact with nature. And most of all, we need not to be excluded. We need to feel some sort of equality. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Great public space is a kind of magical good&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Most things that people buy in stores give them a lot of satisfaction the moment they buy them. But after a few days, that satisfaction decreases, and months later, it completely melts away. But great public space is a kind of magical good. It never ceases to yield happiness. Itâ€™s almost happiness itself. </p>
