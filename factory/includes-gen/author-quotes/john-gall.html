		 <h4>&ldquo;A working simple system&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over beginning with a working simple system. </p>
