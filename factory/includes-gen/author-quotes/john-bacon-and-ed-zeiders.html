		 <h4>&ldquo;We Need a Place to Stand&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Researching my latest book, Fourth and Long, I met Dr. Ed Zeiders, the pastor of St. Paul&#8217;s United Methodist Church in State College. He has seen what a college football team can do for a community in ways others might not. </p>

<p>&#8216;We are desperately needy,&#8217; he told me. &#8216;We need a place to stand, and a people to stand with, and a cause to stand for. That is not original with me. That came out of World Methodism. And those three propositions hold the key to healthy and value-oriented living. Our culture is devoid of these things.&#8217; </p>
