		 <h4>&ldquo;A bicycle for our minds&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud of a showing for the Crown of Creation. That didn&#8217;t look so good, but then someone at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle and a human on a bicycle blew the condor away. That&#8217;s what a computer is to me: the computer is the most remarkable tool that we&#8217;ve ever come up with. It&#8217;s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Technology married with the humanities&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Technology alone is not enough. It&#8217;s technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing. </p>

<p>Nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devices… that need to be even easier to use than a PC, that need to be even more intuitive than a PC; and where the software and the hardware and the applications need to intertwine in an even more seamless way than they do on a PC. </p>

<p>We think we are on the right track with this. We think we have the right architecture not just in silicon but in the organization to build these kinds of products. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Life can be much broader&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Underlying Principle of the Problem&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don&#8217;t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it&#8217;s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That&#8217;s sort of the middle, and that&#8217;s where most people stop&#8230;. But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &#8211; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That&#8217;s what we wanted to do with Mac. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>In most people&#8217;s vocabularies, design means veneer. It&#8217;s interior decorating. It&#8217;s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Good Management is Like The Beatles&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>My model of management is the Beatles. The reason I say that is because each of the key people in the Beatles kept the others from going off in the directions of their bad tendencies. </p>

<p>They sort of kept each other in check. And then when they split up, they never did anything as good. It was the chemistry of a small group of people, and that chemistry was greater than the sum of the parts. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Making something with a great deal of care and love&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. </p>

<p>And you never meet the people. You never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Jobs: What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And are people willing to tell you you&#8217;re wrong? </p>

<p>Jobs: (laughs) Yeah. </p>

<p>Mossberg: I mean, other than snarky journalists, I mean people that work for… </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh, yeah, no we have wonderful arguments. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And do you win them all? </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can&#8217;t. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay. </p>

<p>Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. </p>

<p>Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn&#8217;t? </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;I love and admire my species&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  </p>

<p>I do not make any of my own clothing.  </p>

<p>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  </p>

<p>I did not discover the mathematics I use.  </p>

<p>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  </p>

<p>I am moved by music I did not create myself.  </p>

<p>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  </p>

<p>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  </p>

<p>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. </p>
