		 <h4>&ldquo;The freedom to enact other forms of social existence&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>If something did go terribly wrong in human history &#8211; and given the current state of the world, it&#8217;s hard to deny something did &#8211; then perhaps it began to go wrong precisely when people started losing that freedom to imagine and enact other forms of social existence, to such a degree that some now feel this particular type of freedom hardly even existed, or was barely exercised, for the greater part of human history. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Many humans just don't like their families&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship: many humans just don&#8217;t like their families very much. And this appears to be just as true of present-day hunter-gatherers as anybody else. Many seem to find the prospect of living their entire lives surrounded by close relatives so unpleasant that they will travel very long distances just to get away from them. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Three basic forms of social liberty&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>But for us, the key point to remember is that we are not talking here about &#8216;freedom&#8217; as an abstract ideal or formal principle (as in &#8216;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity!&#8217;). Over the course of these pages we have instead talked about basic forms of social liberty which one might actually put into practice: (1) the freedom to move away or relocate from one&#8217;s surroundings; (2) the freedom to ignore or disobey commands issued by others; and (3) the freedom to shape entirely new social realities, or shift back and forth between different ones. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Very large social units are imaginary&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Very large social units are always, in a sense, imaginary. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, there is always a fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family, neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly, and the way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. </p>
