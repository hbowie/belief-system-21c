			 <p>Q. What ideals have you embraced from Steve Jobs? </p>

<p>A. The importance of doing everything you do to your very best. And that the journey is the reward. If you do things well one at a time, you end up in a really good place. Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself. Control the things you can. </p>
