		 <h4>&ldquo;Only Two Sources of Real Wealth&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We have had to learn the bitter lesson that in all the world there are only two sources of real wealth: the fruit of the earth and the labor of men; and to estimate work not by the money it brings to the producer, but by the worth of the thing that is made. </p>
