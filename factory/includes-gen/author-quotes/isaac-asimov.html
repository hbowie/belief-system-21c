		 <h4>&ldquo;The Cult of Ignorance&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>
