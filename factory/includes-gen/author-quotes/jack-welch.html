		 <h4>&ldquo;Shareholder Value&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy&#8230; your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products. Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal. &#8230; Short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company. </p>
