		 <h4>&ldquo;A Long Conversation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>At this point, I&#8217;m in the middle of a very long conversation with my audience. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s an ongoing dialogue about what living means. You create a space together. You are involved in an act of the imagination together, imagining the life you want to live, the kind of country you want to live in, the kind of place you want to leave to your children. What are the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things that bring on the darkness, and what can we do together to combat those things? That&#8217;s the dialogue I have in my imagination when I&#8217;m writing. I have it in front of me when I&#8217;m performing. </p>
