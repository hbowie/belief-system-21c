		 <h4>&ldquo;the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Many biologists and social scientists have noted that with the development of human culture, the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution. The construction of artificial environments and social structures created new criteria for selection, and biological fitness was replaced by &#8216;cultural fitness&#8217;, which is often different for different cultures and is generally not measured by the number of offspring. Moreover, the mechanism of socio-cultural evolution is different from the model of biological evolution that was proposed by Charles Darwin (1809–1882), and refined by many others. In essence, socio-cultural evolution is &#8216;Lamarckian&#8217; in nature &#8211; it is an example of acquired inheritance, as described by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) &#8211; because humans are able to pass on cultural achievements to the next generation. </p>
