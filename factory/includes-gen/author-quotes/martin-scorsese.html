		 <h4>&ldquo;Cinema was about revelation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. </p>
