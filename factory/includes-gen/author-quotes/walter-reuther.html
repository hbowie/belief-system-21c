		 <h4>&ldquo;Walter Reuther and the Ford Robots&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Walter Reuther, the pioneer UAW organizer, told the story of a conversation with a Ford executive who was showing Reuther his new factory robots. &#8220;How are you going to collect union dues from all these machines?&#8221; he asked. Reuther said he replied, &#8220;You know, that is not what&#8217;s bothering me. I&#8217;m troubled by the problem of how to sell automobiles to them.&#8221; </p>
