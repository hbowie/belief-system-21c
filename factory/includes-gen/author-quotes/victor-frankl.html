		 <h4>&ldquo;To choose one's attitude&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms &#8211; to choose one&#8217;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#8217;s own way. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Each man is questioned by life&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Love is the ultimate and the highest goal&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth &#8211; that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. </p>
