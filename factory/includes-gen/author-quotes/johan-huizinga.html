		 <h4>&ldquo;Play is a thing on its own&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The incidence of play is not associated with any particular stage of civilization or view of the universe. Any thinking person can see at a glance that play is a thing on its own, even if his language possesses no general concept to express it. Play cannot be denied. You can deny, if you like, nearly all abstractions: justice, beauty, truth, goodness, mind, God. You can deny seriousness, but not play. </p>
