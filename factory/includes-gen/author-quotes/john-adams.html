		 <h4>&ldquo;I must study politics and war&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain. </p>
