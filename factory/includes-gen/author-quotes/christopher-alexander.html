		 <h4>&ldquo;A myth that a person need only do inner work&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need only do inner work, in order to be alive like this; that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself … The fact is, a person is so far formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings. </p>
