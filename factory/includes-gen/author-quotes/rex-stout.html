		 <h4>&ldquo;You can't dance cheerfully&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>As a dancing partner Rose Tuttle was not a bargain. She was equipped for it physically and she had some idea of rhythm, that wasn&#8217;t it; it was her basic attitude. She danced cheerfully, and of course that was no good. You can&#8217;t dance cheerfully. Dancing is too important. It can be wild or solemn or gay or lewd or art for art&#8217;s sake, but it can&#8217;t be cheerful. </p>
