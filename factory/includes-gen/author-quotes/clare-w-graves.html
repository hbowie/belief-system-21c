		 <h4>&ldquo;Egocentric Existence&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Both the authoritarian and the submissive develop standards which they feel will insure them against threat, but these are very raw standards. The submissive person chooses to get away with what he can within the life style which is possible for him. The authoritarian chooses to do as he pleases. He spawns, as his raison d&#8217;Ãªtre, the rights of assertive individualism. These rights become, in time, the absolute rights of kings, the unassailable prerogatives of management, the inalienable rights of those who have achieved positions of power, and even the rights of the lowly hustler to all he can hustle. This is a world of the aggressive expression of man&#8217;s lusts openly and unabashedly by the &#8216;haves,&#8217; and more covertly and deviously by the &#8216;have nots.&#8217; </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Man's nature is an open, constantly evolving system&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The error which most people make when they think about human values is that they assume the nature of man is fixed and there is a single set of human values by which he should live. Such an assumption does not fit with my research. My data indicate that man&#8217;s nature is an open, constantly evolving system, a system which proceeds by quantum jumps from one steady state system to the next through a hierarchy of ordered systems. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;While he was focusing on the inner self, his outer world has gone to pot&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>At the personalistic level (F-S), man becomes centrally concerned with peace with his inner self and in the relation of his self to the inner self of others. He becomes concerned with belonging, with being accepted, with knowing the inner side of self and other selves so harmony can come to be, so people as individuals can be at peace with themselves and thus with the world. And when he achieves this, he finds he must become concerned with more than self or other selves, because while he was focusing on the inner self to the exclusion of the external world, his outer world has gone to pot. So now he turns outward to life and to the whole, the total universe. As he does so he begins to see the problems of restoring the balance of life which has been torn asunder by his individualistically oriented, self-seeking climb up the first ladder of existence. </p>
