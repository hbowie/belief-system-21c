		 <h4>&ldquo;Nirvana Antipattern&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The typical, and primary, root cause of [the Nirvana] AntiPattern is the misguided notion that conflict is bad, and therefore should be avoided at all costs. In reality, conflict in the form of tension &#8230; is a necessary part of any difficult task that involves intelligent people who care about their work. </p>
