		 <h4>&ldquo;The Songs are my Lexicon&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Here&#8217;s the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don&#8217;t find it anywhere else. Songs like &#8220;Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain&#8221; or &#8220;I Saw the Light&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s my religion. I don&#8217;t adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I&#8217;ve learned more from the songs than I&#8217;ve learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs. </p>
