		 <h4>&ldquo;I learned a lot of things from failure&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>I learned a lot of things from failure. When you play 162 games, I don&#8217;t think any sport emulates life like baseball. You play football once a week or basketball twice. But you start playing baseball, you play every day, day in and day out. And you understand in a hurry that you&#8217;re going to have bad days and bad nights. You&#8217;re going to have bad weeks, and you just have to make up your mind that, hey, tomorrow&#8217;s tomorrow, and you forget about it. </p>
