		 <h4>&ldquo;Thinking's a Dizzy Business&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Nobody thinks clearly, no matter what they pretend. Thinking&#8217;s a dizzy business, a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can. That&#8217;s why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions; because, compared to the haphazard way in which they&#8217;re arrived at, even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear, sane and self-evident. And if you let it get away from you, then you&#8217;ve got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place. </p>
