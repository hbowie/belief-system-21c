		 <h4>&ldquo;A multiethnic democracy in which no particular ethnic group is in the majority&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The simple fact of the matter is that the world has never built a multiethnic democracy in which no particular ethnic group is in the majority and where political equality, social equality and economies that empower all have been achieved. We are engaged in a fight over whether to work together to build such a world. </p>
