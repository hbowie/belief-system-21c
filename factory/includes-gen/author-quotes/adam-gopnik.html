		 <h4>&ldquo;Absorption in something outside us&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Genuine happiness is always rooted in absorption in something outside us, and begins in accomplishment undertaken for its own sake and pursued to its own odd and buzzing ends. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Human psychology will never be fully explained&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It&#8217;s all the reasons why human psychology will never be fully explained or pictured by scientific investigation — there are just too many variables, too many vectors pressing in on every incident. It&#8217;s the reason why storytelling and songwriting and poetry-making will always be so much more effective organizers and vehicles of our experience than studies in social science. </p>
