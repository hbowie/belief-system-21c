		 <h4>&ldquo;The only thing that's constant there is other people&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>This is part of the model that we&#8217;ve developed called the social baseline model. When you average everything out that humans have experienced, over millennia, the only thing that&#8217;s constant is other humans. We&#8217;re so adaptable, we&#8217;ve been to so many places; we live in the arctic and the equator. We eat whale blubber and unrefined grains. We&#8217;ve been to the moon and practically at the bottom of the ocean. The only thing that&#8217;s constant there is other people. </p>
