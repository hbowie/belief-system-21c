		 <h4>&ldquo;Engineer and designer need to party together&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Prior to Steve Jobs’ return to Apple, there was a decent centralized usability team equipped with those fancy rooms with one-way mirrors and video cameras. I’m certain these folks did significant work, but when Jobs returned, he shut it down and he cast the design teams to the wind. Each product team inherited part of the former usability team. </p>

<p>Now, I arrived after this reorganization occurred, so I don’t know the actual reasoning, but I do know I never saw those usability labs used once and I would argue that in the past decade Apple has created some of the most usable products out there. My opinion is that the choice to spread the usability design function across the engineering team was intended to send a clear message: engineer and designer need to party more… together. </p>

<p>I can’t imagine building a team responsible for consumer products where engineers and designers weren’t constantly meddling in each other’s business. Yes, they often argue from completely opposite sides of the brain. Yes, it is often a battle of art and science, but engineering and design want exactly the same thing. They want the intense satisfaction of knowing they successfully built something that matters. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;History as Postmodern Collage&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Sitting in Princeteon listening to old records, we became obsessed with the past. We tried to pierce the veil of time and grasp what it sounded, felt, looked and smelled like. In Harvard Square and London I met many with similar preoccupations; they didn&#8217;t seem unusual at all. When old blues singers began to reappear, it delivered a rush of excitement and adrenalin. Meeting and traveling with Gary Davis and Lonnie Johnson &#8211; even Coleman Hawkins &#8211; armoured me against a host of disappointments. </p>

<p>History today seems more like a postmodern collage; we are surrounded by two-dimensional representations of our heritage. Access via Amazon.com or iPod to all those boxed sets of old blues singers &#8211; or Nick Drake, for that matter &#8211; doesn&#8217;t equate with the sense of discovery and connection we experienced. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;My brain felt hungry&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>That’s how my brain felt to me, too. Hungry. Needy. Itchy. Once it wanted information. But then it was distraction. And then, with social media, validation. A drumbeat of: You exist. You are seen. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Social media is hyperactive&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The terms social network and social media are used interchangeably now, but they shouldn’t be. A social network is an idle, inactive system &#8211; a Rolodex of contacts, a notebook of sales targets, a yearbook of possible soul mates. But social media is active &#8211; hyperactive, really &#8211; spewing material across those networks instead of leaving them alone until needed. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Technological Unemployment&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come &#8211; namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;To distract the watchdog of the mind&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the ‘content’ of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. </p>
