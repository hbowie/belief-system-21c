		 <h4>&ldquo;Progress Depends on Retentiveness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. </p>
