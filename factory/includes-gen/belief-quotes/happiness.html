		 <h4>&ldquo;Absorption in something outside us&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Genuine happiness is always rooted in absorption in something outside us, and begins in accomplishment undertaken for its own sake and pursued to its own odd and buzzing ends. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;What we need for happiness&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>And what are our needs for happiness? We need to walk, just as birds need to fly. We need to be around other people. We need beauty. We need contact with nature. And most of all, we need not to be excluded. We need to feel some sort of equality. </p>
