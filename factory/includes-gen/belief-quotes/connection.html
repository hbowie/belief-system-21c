		 <h4>&ldquo;All children of our Earth&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We were flying over America, and suddenly I saw snow, the first snow we ever saw from orbit. I have never visited America, but I imagined that the arrival of autumn and winter is the same there as in other places, and the process of getting ready for them is the same. And then it struck me that we are all children of our Earth. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Challenge of Swing&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Swing — the dance and the music — bespeaks the flexible nature of American life. In jazz, the bass walks a note on every beat. The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat. And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with, against, and upside every beat. Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another. This is what makes swinging so challenging. You are forced to be constantly aware of other people&#8217;s feelings. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Crosscutting Alliances&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Where a society&#8217;s political divisions are crosscutting, we line up on different sides of issues with different people at different times. We may disagree with our neighbors on abortion but agree with them on health care; we may dislike another neighbor&#8217;s views on immigration but agree with them on the need to raise the minimum wage. Such alliances help us build and sustain norms of mutual toleration. When we agree with our political rivals at least some of the time, we are less likely to view them as mortal enemies. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A diminishing sense of shared humanity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>In grounded theory, researchers try to understand what we call &#8216;the main concern&#8217; of study participants. When it comes to belonging, I asked: What are people trying to achieve? What are they worried about? </p>

<p>The answer was surprisingly complex. They want to be a part of something &#8211; to experience real connection with others &#8211; but not at the cost of their authenticity, freedom, or power. Participants further reported feeling surrounded by &#8216;us versus them&#8217; cultures that create feelings of spiritual disconnection. When I dug deeper into what they meant by &#8216;spiritually disconnected,&#8217; the research participants described a diminishing sense of shared humanity. Over and over, participants talked about their concern that the only thing that binds us together now is shared fear and disdain, not common humanity, shared trust, respect or love. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are all aware, if we have ever tried it, how empty and ghostly is a life lived for a long while in absolute solitude. Free me from my fellows, let me alone to work out the salvation of my own glorious self, and surely (so I may fancy) I shall now for the first time show who I am. No, not so; on the contrary I merely show in such a case who I am not. I am no longer friend, brother, companion, co-worker, servant, citizen, father, son; I exist for nobody; and ere-long, perhaps to my surprise, generally to my horror, I discover that I <em>am</em> nobody. </p>

			 <p>As we explore the natural history of tribalism, we will see that some three hundred thousand years ago humans chanced upon a revolutionary adaptation that led to the encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA. This was the evolution of nested groups, each with their own particular symbols &#8211; and enshrined shared myths and values &#8211; that bound participants together in trusting relationships. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>&#8230;note that this implicit recognition of the right-side traits by the excellent companies is directly at the expense of more traditional left-brain business practices: causes to fight for are a long way from thirty quarterly MBO objectives. The intimate team or small division ignores scale economies. Allowing freedom of expression by thousands of quality circles flies in the face of the &#8216;one best way&#8217; of traditional production organization. </p>

			 <p>One basic prescription is to do everything possible to re-create the ancestral social environment of small groups of nurturing individuals who know each other by their actions. Provide such an environment, and prosocial child development and adult relations will take place with surprising ease. In the absence of a nurturing social environment, the shaping of behavior will lead in a very different direction &#8211; survival and reproductive strategies that are predicated on the absence of social support, that benefit me and not you, us and not them, today without regard for tomorrow. That&#8217;s what Tony means by calling nurturance a master variable. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Our tribal instincts are not bugs&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Especially in a time of powerful and shifting politics, we shouldn’t ignore our quintessential human capacities to bond with our communities. Nor should we delude ourselves that the thin gruel of rationality and universalism will mobilize people to accomplish desired goals. </p>

<p>I write as a convert to the advocacy of tribalism. I used to consider group-related instincts as a detrimental force in human affairs. I was raised (as you may have been too) to see rationality, creativity, and morality as the hallmarks of humanity, and I viewed conformity, status-seeking, and traditionalism as fallibilities. But based on what I’ve learned from decades as a behavioral scientist, I’ve come to see my former humanities worldview as naive, or at least incomplete. Our tribal instincts are not bugs in the system that hinder an otherwise intelligent species. They are the distinguishing features of our kind that enabled its evolutionary ascent—and still drive many of its greatest achievements today. They are not human foibles that hold us back; they are human superpowers that create our distinctive cultures. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>You mean to tell me you&#8217;d try to kill the John Doe movement if you can&#8217;t use it to get what you want? Well, that certainly is a new low. You sit there with your big cigars and think of deliberately killing an idea that has made millions of people a little bit happier. Why look, I&#8217;m just a mug and I know it &#8211; but I&#8217;m beginning to understand a lot of things. Why, your types are as old as history! If you can&#8217;t lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, if you can&#8217;t eat something &#8211; you bury it! Why, this is the one worthwhile idea that&#8217;s come along! People are finally finding out that the guy next door isn&#8217;t a bad egg. That&#8217;s simple, isnt it? And yet a thing like that has got a chance to spread till it touches every last doggone human being in the world &#8211; and you talk about killing it! Well, when this fire dies down what&#8217;s going to be left? More misery! More hunger and more hate! And what&#8217;s to prevent that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one. The John Doe idea may be the answer though, it may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world, yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you&#8217;ll kill it if you can&#8217;t use it! Well, you go ahead and try &#8211; you couldn&#8217;t do it in a million years with all your radio stations, and all your power. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Moral guidance about what is right or decent can be found both in religious teachings and in our contemporary understanding of what we owe one another as members of the same society. As I have suggested, they overlap. A public morality that protects our democratic institutions, cherishes the truth, accepts our differences, ensures equal rights and equal opportunity, and invites passionate enagement in our civic life gives our own lives deeper meaning. It enlarges our capacities for attachment and love. It informs our sense of honor and shame. It equips us to be virtuous citizens. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Records we made together in the sixties&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>These days most engineers confronted with a displeasing sound reach for the knobs on the console and tweak the high, mid or low frequencies. When that process is inflicted on more and more tracks of a multi-channel recording the sound passes through dozens of transistors, resulting in a narrower, more confined sound. With the added limitations of digital sound, you end up with a bright and shiny, thin and two-dimensional recording. To my ears anyway. </p>

<p>When John [Wood] heard a sound he didn&#8217;t like, he would lift his bulky frame off the chair and lumber down the stairs, muttering all the way. I began to be able to predict whether he was going to try a different microphone, reposition the existing one or shift the offending musician to another part of the studio. When I listen to records we made together in the sixties, I can still hear the air in the studio and the full dimension of the sounds the musicians created for us. I can hear the depth of Nick Drake&#8217;s breath as well as his voice, the grit in the crude strings of Robin Williamson&#8217;s <cite>gimbri</cite> and Dave Mattacks&#8217; drum technique spread out warmly in aural Technicolor across the stereo spectrum. </p>

			 <p>Sacred values differ from material or instrumental values in that they incorporate moral beliefs, such as the welfare of family, commitment to country, or identification with a particular religion that is thought to be absolute and inviolable. Sharing of these stories demonstrates honest reliable signals that an individual values the group and its goals. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the sharing of these sacred values is essential to the formation and maintenance of group identity. </p>

			 <p>Most people tend to think that characteristics of a person drive whether someone is ethical or not. For example, one’s upbringing, religious values or even genetics must determine whether a person is a good apple or a bad egg. While those factors matter to some degree, my research and decades of science in social and organizational psychology tell us that we vastly underestimate the impact of our immediate environment on our behavior. Good people can do bad things in certain contexts, and the reverse is true as well. </p>

And when you see that, you can&#8217;t be arrogant, you can&#8217;t be supercilious. You discover that you have your position because of the events of history and because of individuals in the background making it possible for you to stand there. </p>
