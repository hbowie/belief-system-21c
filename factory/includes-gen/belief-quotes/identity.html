		 <h4>&ldquo;The new form of the problem of identity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The individual is forced to turn inward; he becomes obsessed with the new form of the problem of identity, namely, Even-if-I-know-who-I-am, I-have-no-significance. I am unable to influence others. The next step is apathy. And the step following that is violence. For no human being can stand the perpetually numbing experiene of his own powerlessness. </p>
