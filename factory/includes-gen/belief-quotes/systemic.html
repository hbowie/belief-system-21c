		 <h4>&ldquo;Ancient ethnic sores belching fire&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The complications of this diversity can be overwhelming. Ancient ethnic sores are belching fire while transnational companies linked by satellites conduct their business oblivious to the feudal past below. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Capitalism as a Market Society&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Readers may be surprised by the absence of any mention of &#8216;capital&#8217; or &#8216;capitalism&#8217; in the book. I chose to leave out such words not because there is anything wrong with them but because, loaded as they are with heavy baggage, they get in the way of illuminating the essence of things. So, instead of speaking about capitalism, I use the term &#8216;market society.&#8217; Instead of &#8216;capital,&#8217; you will find more normal words like &#8216;machinery&#8217; and &#8216;produced means of production.&#8217; Why use jargon if we can avoid it? </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Competition is not separable from endless flavors of cooperation&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Her trees are far more social than even Patricia suspected. There are no individuals. There aren&#8217;t even separate species. Everything in the forest is the forest. Competition is not separable from endless flavors of cooperation. Trees fight no more than do the leaves on a single tree. It seems most of nature <em>isn&#8217;t</em> red in tooth and claw, after all. For one, those species at the base of the living pyramid have neither teeth nor talons. But if trees share their storehouses, then every drop of red must float on a sea of green. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;In the thrall of a vast, world-spanning machine&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We are already in the thrall of a vast, world-spanning machine that, due to errors in its foundational programming, has developed a disdain for human beings, is working to make them irrelevant, and resists all attempts to bring it back under control. It is not yet intelligent or autonomous, and it still depends on its partnership with humans, but it grows more powerful and more independent every day. We are engaged in a battle for the soul of this machine, and we are losing. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Learning from Experience&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The most powerful learning comes from direct experience. But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? Herein lies the core <em>learning dilemma</em> that confronts organizations:<em> we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions.</em> The most critical decisions made in organizations have systemwide consequences that stretch over years or decades. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The modern horrors of bureaucracy&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Yet the people here suffered, apparently, from the fact that they were employed not by an educational institution, but by a bureaucratic system. They were all, to a large extent, clerks, neatly bound up in red tape, and, like clerks, they gave themselves the illusion of freedom by discussing and ridiculing the strictures that bound them. Kate thought lovingly of her own university, where one struggled, God knew, against the ancient sins of favoritism, flattery, and simony, but where the modern horrors of bureaucracy had not yet strangled her colleagues or herself. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Which side will lose by winning&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Aspens are withering. Grazed on by everything with hooves, cut off from rejuvenating fire, whole groves are vanishing. Now she sees a forest, spreading across these mountains since before humans left Africa, giving way to second homes. She sees it in one great glimpse of flashing gold: trees and humans, at war over the land and water and atmosphere. And she can hear, louder than the quaking leaves, which side will lose by winning. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A working simple system&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over beginning with a working simple system. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The World Empire enforces World Peace&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Most countries no longer engage in full-scale war for the simple reason that they are no longer independent. Though citizens in Israel, Italy, Mexico or Thailand may harbour illusions of independence, the fact is that their governments cannot conduct independent economic or foreign policies, and they are certainly incapable of initiating and conducting full-scale war on their own. As explained in Chapter 11, we are witnessing the formation of a global empire. Like previous empires, this one, too, enforces peace within its borders. And since its borders cover the entire globe, the World Empire effectively enforces world peace. </p>
