		 <h4>&ldquo;Careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The vast majority of difficult, important human problems &#8211; both inside and outside organizations &#8211; are not solved by a swift, decisive stroke from someone at the top. What usually matters are careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts by people working far from the limelight. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Steve Jobs Ideals&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Q. What ideals have you embraced from Steve Jobs? </p>

<p>A. The importance of doing everything you do to your very best. And that the journey is the reward. If you do things well one at a time, you end up in a really good place. Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself. Control the things you can. </p>
