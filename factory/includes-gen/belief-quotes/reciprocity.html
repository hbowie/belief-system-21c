		 <h4>&ldquo;By Gifts One Makes Slaves&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>&#8216;Up in our country we are human!&#8217; said the hunter. &#8216;And since we are human we help each other. We don&#8217;t like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.&#8217; </p>
