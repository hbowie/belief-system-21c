		 <h4>&ldquo;Three basic forms of social liberty&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>But for us, the key point to remember is that we are not talking here about &#8216;freedom&#8217; as an abstract ideal or formal principle (as in &#8216;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity!&#8217;). Over the course of these pages we have instead talked about basic forms of social liberty which one might actually put into practice: (1) the freedom to move away or relocate from one&#8217;s surroundings; (2) the freedom to ignore or disobey commands issued by others; and (3) the freedom to shape entirely new social realities, or shift back and forth between different ones. </p>
