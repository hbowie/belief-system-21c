		 <h4>&ldquo;Belief in Impossible Things&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is probably no job on earth for which an ability to believe six impossible things before breakfast is more of a requirement than software project management. We are routinely expected to work ourselves into a state of believing in a deadline, a budget, or a performance factor that time subsequently may prove to be impossible. </p>
