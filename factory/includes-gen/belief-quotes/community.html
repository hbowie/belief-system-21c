		 <h4>&ldquo;An assembly that meshes over a specific problem&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>To manifest possibility in the zone of dialogical imagination, David [Graeber] learned, there was no need to persuade everybody to agree on every issue. &#8216;You don’t even want to achieve ideological uniformity,&#8217; he averred. An assembly that meshes over a definition of a specific problem and a commitment to a specific course of action forms &#8216;a community of purpose without a community of definition.&#8217; The rules of discourse can support a revisable consensus. Do not blow up minor moral differences into mortal threats. Do extend the benefit of the doubt. Do not reduce perspectives to a juxtaposition of opposite extremes. Do look for zones of affinity. If such rules do not yield a creative synthesis that everybody can accept, then the rules can change. Deliberative assemblies, when properly facilitated, encompass a plurality of perspectives from a perspective that refuses to impose itself as a worldview. The crux is that everybody gets a say. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;We internalize new cultural identities and codes&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Contrary to essentialist views of cultural character as set in stone, people’s cultural conditioning and convictions change over time. We internalize new cultural identities and codes with every new community we join. </p>
