		 <h4>&ldquo;We must discover wisdom for ourselves&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness, which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. </p>
