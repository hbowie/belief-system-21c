		 <h4>&ldquo;Bargaining away the experience of being alive&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>That seems to me the great American danger we&#8217;re all in, that we&#8217;ll bargain away the experience of being alive for the appearance of it. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A Coke is a Coke&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>What&#8217;s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Cult of Ignorance&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Education demands a certain daring&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind. We have to teach young people to think. And to teach young people, in order to teach young people to think, you have to teach them to think about everything. There mustn&#8217;t be something they cannot think about. If there&#8217;s something, if there&#8217;s one thing they can&#8217;t think about, then very shortly they can&#8217;t think about anything, you know. Now, there&#8217;s always something in this country, of course, one cannot think about. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Extent of Freedom in All of its Dimensions&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Ism-mania&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Grandpa: Penny why don&#8217;t you write a play about ism-mania? </p>

<p>Penny: Ism-mania? </p>

<p>Grandpa: Yeah, sure, you know &#8211; communism, fascism, voodooism. Everybody&#8217;s got an ism these days. </p>

<p>Penny: I feel like I&#8217;ve got this itch or something. </p>

<p>Grandpa: It&#8217;s just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ism and you&#8217;re in business. </p>

<p>Penny: I&#8217;ve got it! It might help Cynthia to have an ism in the monastery! </p>

<p>Grandpa: It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans: John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison, Mark Twain. When things got tough for those boys, they didn&#8217;t run around looking for isms. Lincoln said, &#8220;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&#8221; Nowadays they say, &#8220;Think the way I do, or I&#8217;ll bomb the daylights out of you.&#8221; </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Makers of Things&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted &#8211; for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things &#8211; some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>And I’ll miss being able to represent our country. I think, a lot of times, that gets lost, when people talk about me in particular: Oh, you guys don’t sing the anthem, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You don’t love America. But we do love America. It’s just more in a James Baldwin kind of way, not in a bald-eagle-on-your-shoulder kind of way. </p>
