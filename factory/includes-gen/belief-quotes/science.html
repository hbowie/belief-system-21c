		 <h4>&ldquo;An agenda of ambition and hope&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>This spirit of fraternity must enable us to build an agenda of ambition and hope, as our two countries share the same faith in freedom, in democratic values, in empowerment through education and work, and in progress through science and knowledge. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Apes and Humans&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Philosophers and scientists confidently offer up traits said to be uniquely human, and the apes casually knock them down &#8211; toppling the pretension that humans constitute some sort of biological aristocracy among the beings of Earth. Instead, we are more like the nouveau riche, incompletely accommodated to our recent exalted state, insecure about who we are, and trying to put as much distance as possible between us and our humble origins. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>It&#8217;s all the reasons why human psychology will never be fully explained or pictured by scientific investigation — there are just too many variables, too many vectors pressing in on every incident. It&#8217;s the reason why storytelling and songwriting and poetry-making will always be so much more effective organizers and vehicles of our experience than studies in social science. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Mysterious&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery &#8211; even if mixed with fear &#8211; that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man. </p>

			 <p>Watching the man, hard-of-hearing, hard-of-speech Patty learns that real joy consists of knowing that human wisdom counts less than the shimmer of beeches in a breeze. As certain as weather is coming from the west, the things people know for sure will change. There is no knowing <em>for a fact</em>. The only dependable things are humility and looking. </p>
