		 <h4>&ldquo;Myths are stronger than anyone could have imagined&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail&#8217;s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth. </p>

			 <p>During the last 30 years, we have witnessed a historical first: all of the world&#8217;s cultures are now available to us. </p>

<p>&#8230;for the first time, the sum total of human knowledge is available to us&#8211;the knowledge, experience, wisdom and reflection of all major human civilizations&#8211;premodern, modern and postmodern&#8211;are open to study by anyone. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>What you do is you have an idea, and you hold it in your mind as long as it’s useful. And then when it turns out not to be useful, discard it. But the idea of clinging to belief as a basis for your life &#8211; which is what most people do &#8211; is terrifying, because belief is the end of observation. You believe something, you stop seeing everything else. Clearly, that is not desirable. And yet it’s the way most people live. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Many biologists and social scientists have noted that with the development of human culture, the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution. The construction of artificial environments and social structures created new criteria for selection, and biological fitness was replaced by &#8216;cultural fitness&#8217;, which is often different for different cultures and is generally not measured by the number of offspring. Moreover, the mechanism of socio-cultural evolution is different from the model of biological evolution that was proposed by Charles Darwin (1809–1882), and refined by many others. In essence, socio-cultural evolution is &#8216;Lamarckian&#8217; in nature &#8211; it is an example of acquired inheritance, as described by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) &#8211; because humans are able to pass on cultural achievements to the next generation. </p>

			 <p>As any farmer knows, it&#8217;s usually the brightest goat in the herd that stirs up the most trouble, which is why the Agricultural Revolution involved downgrading animals&#8217; mental abilities. The second cognitive revolution, dreamed up by techno-humanists, might do the same to us, producing human cogs who communicate and process data far more effectively than ever before, but who can barely pay attention, dream or doubt. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Beneath the surface, the progressive sixties hid all manner of unpleasantness: sexism, reaction, racism and factionalism. It wasn&#8217;t surprising, really. The idea that drugs, sex and music could transform the world was always a pretty naïve dream. As the counter-culture&#8217;s effect on the mainstream grew, its own values and aesthetics decayed. The political setbacks of the coming years grabbed the headlines while the dilution of ideals happened more quietly, but nonetheless vividly for those who noticed. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Culture and psyche are inexorably intertwined&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>&#8230;by the late twentieth century, it became hard to miss that cultural patterns — of societies and of individuals — were in flux. Across the world, societies were evolving as globalized generations developed new lifestyles through selective retention of their parents’ ways and heightened borrowing from other traditions. Individuals were migrating more than ever but not always assimilating — instead, maintaining multiple cultural worldviews that they switched between situationally. Scholars began to appreciate that it was not simply collective institutions or individual psychologies that determined culture, but the interplay between them. Cultural institutions shape the individual&#8217;s mind, and the individual&#8217;s mind shapes cultural institutions. Culture and psyche are inexorably intertwined. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Cultures as a kind of mental infection&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea &#8211; such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth &#8211; can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them. </p>

<p>For the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie &#8211; deliberate, contrived and dishonest &#8211; but the myth &#8211; persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Both the authoritarian and the submissive develop standards which they feel will insure them against threat, but these are very raw standards. The submissive person chooses to get away with what he can within the life style which is possible for him. The authoritarian chooses to do as he pleases. He spawns, as his raison d&#8217;être, the rights of assertive individualism. These rights become, in time, the absolute rights of kings, the unassailable prerogatives of management, the inalienable rights of those who have achieved positions of power, and even the rights of the lowly hustler to all he can hustle. This is a world of the aggressive expression of man&#8217;s lusts openly and unabashedly by the &#8216;haves,&#8217; and more covertly and deviously by the &#8216;have nots.&#8217; </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The existence and validity of human rights are not written in the stars. The ideals concerning the conduct of men toward each other and the desirable structure of the community have been conceived and taught by enlightened individuals in the course of history. Those ideals and convictions which resulted from historical experience, from the craving for beauty and harmony, have been readily accepted in theory by man &#8211; and at all times, have been trampled upon by the same people under the pressure of their animal instincts. A large part of history is therefore replete with the struggle for those human rights, an eternal struggle in which a final victory can never be won. But to tire in that struggle would mean the ruin of society. </p>

			 <p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience. In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;From a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other. In truth, our concepts &#8216;natural&#8217; and ‘unnatural&#8217; are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural&#8217; is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature&#8217;. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The historical trajectory of violence&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The historical trajectory of violence affects not only how life is lived but how it is understood. What could be more fundamental to our sense of meaning and purpose than a conception of whether the strivings of the human race over long stretches of time have left us better or worse off? How, in particular, are we to make sense of <em>modernity</em> &#8211; of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;History is something very few people have been doing&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than 90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites &#8211; kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers &#8211; who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Homophobia&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>An integral approach acknowledges that all views have a degree of truth, but some views are more true than others, more evolved, more developed, more adequate. And so let&#8217;s get that part out of the way right now: homophobia in any form, as far as I can tell, stems from a lower level of human development &#8211; but it is a level, it exists, and one has to make room in one&#8217;s awareness for those lower levels as well, just as one has to include third grade in any school curriculum. Just don&#8217;t, you know, put those people in charge of anything important. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;If the future of humanity is decided in your absence&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. In theory, anybody can join the debate about the future of humanity, but it is so hard to maintain a clear vision. We might not even notice that a debate is going on, or what the key questions are. Most of us can&#8217;t afford the luxury of investigating, because we have more pressing things to do: we have to go to work, take care of the kids, or look after elderly parents. Unfortunately, history does not give discounts. If the future of humanity is decided in your absence, because you are too busy feeding and clothing your kids, you and they will not be exempt from the consequences. This is unfair: but who said history was fair? </p>

			 <p>The other part of me wanted to get out and stay out. But this was the part I never listened to. Because if I ever had I would have stayed in the town where I was born and worked in the hardware store and married the boss&#8217;s daughter and had five kids and read them the funny paper on Sunday morning and smacked their heads when they got out of line and squabbled with the wife about how much spending money they were to get and what programs they could have on the radio or TV set. I might even have got rich &#8211; small-town rich, an eight-room house, two cars in the garage, chicken every Sunday and the <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> on the living room table, the wife with a cast iron permanent and me with a brain like a sack of Portland cement.

		 <h4>&ldquo;Inextricably Linked in Freedom&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The originators of jazz were only two generations removed from slavery. They were victims of rigorous forms of segregation that routinely and institutionally denied their humanity. So freedom was much more than a word to them. These pioneering musicians were exuberant about exhibiting this newfound personal freedom through their art. But they were also excited about hearing other people do the same thing. They understood that all were inextricably linked in freedom, just as they had been inextricably linked in bondage. And it wasn&#8217;t theory; it was life as they lived it. </p>

			 <p>I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions, but … laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Levels of Development&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let&#8217;s use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture&#8217;s ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant&#8217;s awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture&#8217;s rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child&#8217;s particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual&#8217;s identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p>

<p>Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8211;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples&#8217; lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates. </p>

		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Furthermore, as we have seen for genetic evolution, what&#8217;s adaptive in the evolutionary sense of the word isn&#8217;t necessarily good or right in the normative sense. Genetic evolution often results in adaptations that are good for me but not for you, or us but not them, or good over the short term but not the long term. The behaviors that we adopt by open-ended learning have all the same limitations. If anything, behavioral adaptations are even more shortsighted than genetic evolution because the immediate costs and benefits of our behaviors are more perceptible to us than the long-term consequences. You might want to lose weight, but your mind is causing you to dip your hand into the next bag of Doritos. You might want peace on earth, but your mind is causing you to do what it takes to beat out your competitors for a promotion at the office. A lot of cleverness will be required to align our learning abilities to our long-term personal and societal goals. </p>

			 <p>As we are increasingly coming to realize, our species does represent a new evolutionary process — cultural evolution — that far surpasses cultural traditions in other species. This capacity for cultural evolution enabled our ancestors to spread over the globe, inhabiting all climatic zones and dozens of ecological niches. Then small-scale societies — &#8220;tiny grains of thought&#8221;" — coalesced into larger and larger societies over the past ten thousand years. Human activities now rival other living processes and non-living physical processes in shaping the earth and atmosphere…. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Rationality is not the strong suit of our species&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>My recommendations are not the typical tips from an academic about how to encourage more rational decisions. I think that rationality is not the strong suit of our species. We are <em>Homo tributus</em>, not <em>Homo economicus</em>. Certainly, tribal instincts are part of the problem in many pressing conflicts, but they also can be — and, I think, <em>have to be</em> — part of the solution. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Sacred values&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Sacred values differ from material or instrumental values in that they incorporate moral beliefs, such as the welfare of family, commitment to country, or identification with a particular religion that is thought to be absolute and inviolable. Sharing of these stories demonstrates honest reliable signals that an individual values the group and its goals. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the sharing of these sacred values is essential to the formation and maintenance of group identity. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;Sixties Surpluses of Money and Time&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The atmosphere in which music flourished then had a lot to do with economics. It was a time of unprecedented prosperity. People are supposedly wealthier now, yet most feel they haven&#8217;t enough money and time is at an even greater premium&#8230;. In the sixties, we had surpluses of both money and time. </p>

<p>Friends of mine lived comfortably in Greenwich Village, Harvard Square, Bayswater, Santa Monica and on the Left Bank and were, by current standards, broke. Yet they survived easily on occasional coffee-house gigs or part-time work. Today, urbanites must feverishly maximize their economic potential just to maintain a small flat in Hoboken, Somerville, Hackney, Korea Town or Belleville. The economy of the sixties cut us a lot of slack, leaving time to travel, take drugs, write songs and rethink the universe. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The system has been shaping and reshaping our minds&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>For thousands of years the system has been shaping and reshaping our minds according to its needs. Sapiens originally evolved as members of small intimate communities, and their mental faculties were not adapted to living as cogs within a giant machine. However, with the rise of cities, kingdoms and empires, the system cultivated capacities required for large-scale cooperation, while disregarding other skills and aptitudes. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;These principles have no objective validity&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both Wrong. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;This Highest Kind of Religious Feeling&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man&#8217;s image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;The Three Tribal Instincts&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>For a better understanding of the partisan conflict straining US democracy and the role of our evolved group psychology within it, we can do better by focusing on the three tribal instincts that we have come to know in this book. These are psychological systems for meshing with peers, helping the clan, and maintaining the tribe. These drives have helped human groups survive from the Stone Age to today because they guide constructive collaboration. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A tribe is a creed&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>A tribe is not a race, or even a population&#8230; a tribe is a creed; it is a team that has agreed upon a set of symbols &#8211; including sacred values &#8211; that identify membership. A creed is a mechanism that glues together disparate small camps and bands of cohabitating humans into a singular identity and shared purpose. Those who know the codes have in their possession a social passport. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;An ultracultural species is born&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>Domesticating a wolf brain or an ape brain is impressive. But when you domesticate a <em>human</em> brain &#8211; this is when the real magic begins. An ultracultural species is born. A unique type of friendliness must have evolved in our species that allowed for larger group sizes, higher population densities, and more amicable relations between neighboring groups that in turn created larger social networks. This encouraged the transmission of more innovations between more innovators. Cultural ratcheting went from slow and sporadic to fast and furious. The result was exponential growth in technology and the emergence of behavioral modernity. </p>

		 <h4>&ldquo;A vast repository of information learned and passed down from previous generations&rdquo;</h4>
 
		 <blockquote>
			 <p>With this perspective, you can begin to think of yourself as not just a product of your genes, and not just a product of your personal experience, but also as one of many members of your culture who collectively contain a vast repository of information learned and passed down from previous generations. This makes you part of something larger than yourself. The information has not just been passed down, but it has also been <em>winnowed</em> through the generations, leaving us with a set of beliefs and practices that helped us to cohere as groups. </p>

			 <p>Many people interpret the invisible hand concept as saying, we should just take our hands off the steering wheel like there’s nothing we should do.  I don’t agree with that.  Humans aren’t designed to accept the world as is, so to just say “whatever” is denying what makes us thrive as a species.  More than any other creature on Earth, we have the capacity to envision a better future and make it a reality.  We are askers of the question, “What kind of world do we want?” And perhaps even more importantly, we can ask the follow-up question, “How do we build that?” </p>
