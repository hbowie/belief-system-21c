 <h4>A Human Perspective</h4>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/humanism.html">Humanism</a> Humanism emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, without reference to any non-human authorities. </p>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/art.html">Art</a> We humans create meaning for ourselves through storytelling. That is, we reflect on our experiences and then create narratives, images, shapes and sounds in order to communicate new and interesting perspectives to others. The resulting works of art can then become important elements of our culture. </p>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/written-word.html">The Written Word</a> The written word is an invaluable human tool for sharing information and ideas between members of a generation, as well as for passing along information and ideas from one generation to the next. </p>
