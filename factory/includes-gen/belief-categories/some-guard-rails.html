<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/imperfection.html">Imperfection</a> We harbor no romantic notions about the perfectibility of humans or of human society, but instead are satisfied with progress, and do not demand perfection. </p>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/balance.html">Balance</a> It is generally best to strive for a reasonable balance between competing concerns, rather than viewing any one of them as fundamentally absolute. </p>
