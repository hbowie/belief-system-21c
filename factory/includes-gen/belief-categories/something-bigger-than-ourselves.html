 <h4>Something Bigger than Ourselves</h4>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/connection.html">Connection</a> A feeling of caring connection to others is part of what makes us human, and is the central force that makes each one of us part of something larger than our individual selves. </p>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/love.html">Love</a> Let us call love the apprehension of something outside of oneself, some being or form that is other than our self, and yet that affirms the possibility of a greater unity of which we are each but parts, a unity that leaves us still ourselves, and yet also part of something inestimably greater. </p>

<p><a class="belief-name" href="beliefs/wonder.html">Wonder</a> A sense of wonder opens our hearts and minds to fresh perspectives and new possibilities. </p>
