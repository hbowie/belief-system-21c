These are eight principles that, when followed, improve the effectiveness of human groups.

And when we use the word "group," I take this to mean a group of humans deriving perceived benefit from a shared set of resources, working towards a common goal, with some unifying identity, and with established means of interaction.

I originally encountered these principles in [David Sloan Wilson][wilson]'s book, *[This View of Life][tvol].* If you'd like another description of these principles that is freely available on the web, you can refer to this [PDF](https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Generalizing-the-Core.pdf) of an article originally published in the *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*. 

[Elinor Ostrom][lin] won a Nobel Prize for her work in this area. These principles were based -- not on abstract or aspirational ideas about how such groups *should* work, or reasons why they *could not possibly work* -- but on actual observation of the attributes of groups that *actually did work*.

As soon as I read these, I recognized their significance, and the ways in which they supported and mirrored many of the principles of the [Agile software development][agile] movement, with which I was already familiar.  

I believe these principles to be universal and scalable to groups of any size.

Here, then, are the eight core design principles for the efficacy of groups.
